1. Cost of renting the building the repair shop is in (or mortgage and real estate taxes if the building is owned)

2. Cost of upgrades and maintenance on repair shop equipment

3. Cost of advertising the services at the shop (for example, about half of the cost of McDonald's food is marketing)

4. Cost of social security and medicare that the employer has to make (about 6%)

5. Cost of business licenses and insurance.

6. Cost of non-payment (e.g. credit cards take around 3% for guarantee of payment)

7. State sales tax

8. Federal employment taxes other than social security, such as unemployment, as well as local taxes. 

9. Business licensing costs

10. Insurance for the business, the employees (e.g. workman's comp), the building (if owned), etc. etc.

My biggest concern with the programs is it is one thing to learn how to create a model, but it is an entirely more difficult challange to know when to create a model, and I feel that second part is where schools tend to flop. Let me give you a real example from my experience:

I was tasked to make a product recommendation model, and I remembered back at school we learned about the Apriori algorithm and how that is exactly what Amazon uses for their recommendation engine. So great, I set out to implement Apriori, I created all these indicators for demographics and whether or not the customer bought product X, and I got some results. But here is the issue. My company only offers like 6 different products. I know now that Apriori doesn't work in this scenario because there isn't enough predictive power in just the 6 products and for the most part they are all quite independent and the average customer only buys 2 of them so the cross sell data is quite sparse. Combine all of this with the fact that these products have a defined order in terms of profit (Product A is more profitable than Product B is more profitable than C, etc.) and you start to realize really quickly that you don't need data science to solve those problem, you just need a linear If statement: 

If customer does not have A, recommend A
ElseIF customer does not have B, recommendation B, etc.

saveliyvasilev,"I did some projects where I was an IC in DS and then managed technical teams with a lot of business exposure to my entire teams. Based on that, a brain dump of how to leverage analysts:

They should become the SMEs within the project, and glue multiple parties together so the project can deliver properly. A couple of tactical things that I found useful while being a consultant in a generalist firm:

They should help you present early-stage results while the project is in half-discovery half-prototype to the ops / business folks. This means: put together some dashboards that help visualize the typical questions the business team will have, put together a deck, etc.

They should build relationships as any good consultants with your client. While doing this they should learn a lot about the intricate ways each business unit operates.

They should help you probe waters when it would be convenient to model something differently. Oftentimes, the technical challenges are surprisingly easy to solve by talking to business, and it's surprisingly easy to try to solve tough technical challenges that originated in a poor business understanding. So a good analyst should ask ""can't we maybe simplify this specific thing? What else can we do to deliver value here that might be technically simpler?""

They should help you testing data quality -- you know, do some basic EDA stuff to de-risk the project

They should help you by following-up with clients' technical teams to deliver the data / apis / whatever you need to make it a success

They should raise the feelings of the business side when something can go south, so you can talk to your client and learn why they're worried: if they have a good reason to be worried you better know of it asap, and if they're worried because they misunderstand something it's a great moment to build trust and momentum

They should be able to play back the main points of what your findings are, they should challenge you and ask those pesky questions that a reasonable business person would. It's on you to learn how to translate the technical findings to a business team -- this will set you apart. Very few care about a p-value or ROC AUC metric; they care about having some certainty on what the likely implications are.

TucamonParrot,"All I hear is blind profit over everything else. 

I mocked oligopolies as a whole, not in reference to Boeing. You sound like the classical case of supporting big money for the sake of not addressing the elephant in the room - multimillionaires and billionaires not paying taxes. Your concerted effort averts this as a problem. It's the same thinking that got us into trouble in the first by allowing corporations treatment as people, and then getting away with not paying their dues when they liquidate jobs by moving them abroad i.e could be a friend's job, family member's job, and it's to make a profit. 

It's funny, you haven't demonstrated any ethical concerns, you're still just concerned about the bottom dollar. There's more to life than money..

It's a marketplace unchecked for too long. It's not just capitalism, the whole world is seeing exploitation at record levels. Don't believe, then do your research. 

I'm not going to argue that the US is better than the world, look at surveys lately and you'll see 18-34 are considering leaving the US because of 'market dynamics'. Getting thrown news article after news article about companies laying people off, raising prices (even though supply chains have recovered), and still record profits? If that's not a big slap to the face of American people, and people abroad, then I don't what gets you out of bed. 

There's a problem, mkay? You're part of it because you refuse to see the difference from propaganda tied into politics.

Going back to the oligopoly conversation, Airbus is killing it in the market due to Boeing's only for profit models. The US market has seen several monopolist and antitrust mergers over the past decade. Just look at T-Mobile, they arguably put a massive damper on competition. Didn't they get sued in the last decade? Maybe a more recent example like Google. They're facing antitrust violations currently. Rightfully or not, it's going to allow for a small business to have a chance and shake things up via innovation. 

For the modern world you and I want, we need more smaller companies to disrupt profits for the giant companies as it forces them to enforce better standards - like the smaller companies usually do.*
Asterisk because it's not always true. Though, smaller businesses have been pummeled given that operating expenses for larger companies results in greater kickbacks usually not symmetrical in to 'the little company'. 

Your part about a war in Europe, it could have happened anywhere, except that the US is an ocean apart and the history of European countries far out numbers the significance of US history. It's a moot point to begin with, it's totally completely irrelevant to our conversation. 

The only way companies improve is via equivalences to what a sanction is - reduced funding and access to capital. It's like issuing you a big ass fine and if you try to bribe the officials then the fines go up. Currently, there's nothing to prevent that because the supreme court is garbage and shot down imposing ""gifts"" as a restriction. No, you clearly want this loophole of ""legal bribery"" to stay open.

The point at the heart of my message that skipped off the pond for you is to see things from another perspective. I'm happy to keep calling out corruption in not just the US, but also abroad in efforts for you to see how bad it's getting. It's a burden for all of us to continue allowing things to 'not change'. It's about the status quo being delivered due justice for once, seeing your tax dollars to funding your children's education...just like how those costs were unsymmetrically much lower in decades prior in comparison to the low wages of today. Unchecked Capitalism got us to today, where you agree or not, anything unchecked for too long creates mass hysteria. In my humble opinion, more people tend to agree with me regardless that they love the US, or elsewhere. It's about making sure companies like Boeing don't continue to just replace the head of the snake with another person that's all about profit versus safety. That's the problem here.

We did \*everything\* they asked for and clarified the approach but they never replied to our comments. The AC just said reviewers were unsatisfied with the work and AC agrees with reviewers so Reject. I was expecting at least some comments from AC on what was the discussion after the rebuttal, did the reviewers understood the work properly and finally what was the AC's review. Just saying that AC agrees with reviewers and not providing any further feedback is very demotivating.

Fayko,">I mean sure, foreign-induced propaganda can be punished with treason. But what about the other kinds of propaganda? Those are still a huge problem, and you can't punish that with treason or any other charge, really.

Treason is a crime that can only be applied domestically. What are you talking about? You cannot charge foreigners with treason lol. 

>Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.



>Not relevant you think? I think it's really relevant. I think that slapping treason labels around doesn't solve the fact that social media is built to promote propagandistic discourse of all kinds, because a slogan travels way faster than 5000 words essay. But what do I know, this is all gibberish right?

Wtf are you on about lol? Social media was not built to promote ""propagandistic"" (whatever the fuck that is) discourse of all kinds. It's a platform for social interactions. Just because Elon bought Twitter and turned it into a texted based RT doesn't mean that's social media as a whole.

eloquent_beaver,"*Tax evasion* has a specific, legal meaning. It means avoiding paying lawful taxes. The law was clear, and Apple was paying the taxes the law required them to. They didn't evade any taxes because they paid every cent the law required them to. Collecting back taxes from a tax evader is not what retroactive taxation means.

Say you live in the US and lawfully claimed an EV tax credit last year. If tomorrow a new tax law passes that removes EV tax credit and raises the tax rate for your bracket 1 million percent, that's fine. That affects your taxes going forward.

What *retroactive taxation* would be is if they said, okay, because of this new law, you also have to go back to all your old tax returns and amend them to take out the EV tax credit and also retroactively apply this new tax rate to your income. That's retroactive taxation. It's fine to change changes going forward. Applying them backward in time and ""changing laws in the past"" is the problem.

What was legal then was legal then. You can make it illegal tomorrow, but it's a huge problem when a government retroactively applies new laws. Because people can only make decisions based on the present. They can't be expected nor would it be fair if they have to guess what the future multiverse holds (should I eat a pancake for breakfast? what if pancakes become illegal in 10 years and even though I'm not committing any crime right now, they'll later decide I was committing a crime all along and punish me then for what is legal now?).

One of the main reasons I was ok with spending this kind of money in the first place was I didn’t have to renew it like the CISSP.   

I wonder what’s really driving this change. Offsec seems to say a lot of employers are seeking some type of “up to date” verification while others are speculating it’s to please the DoD’s requirements of renewing certs with CPEs and additional training.

To be fair, they do eventually offset this and become more clean than their alternatives but it takes tens of thousands of miles, and even then they’re still not really great for the environment. 

They’re also not amazing to live with. If you aren’t able to charge at home you’re at the mercy of the public networks. Here in the US there are hardly any EVSCs outside of California and 1/4 of them are broken because we don’t maintain our existing infrastructure already. If you live in a northern climate your range will be halved in the winter too. Battery packs are also astronomically expensive to replace if something goes wrong. 

Lastly; electric cars are a major public safety hazard. They burn for days when they catch ablaze and they burn very, very hot, and our fire departments aren’t really equipped to deal with them yet. 

This also isn’t mentioning how electric cars are being used to push microtransactions; limiting what you can do with your existing hardware. Mercedes for example locks horsepower/performance for their EQE and EQS EVs behind a paywall despite you having already purchased the hardware. People really don’t like that sort of thing, and neither should you.

thatohgi,"Washington — Two Russian nationals working for a news network controlled by Vladimir Putin’s government funneled millions of dollars to an American media company that paid right-wing influencers for videos pushing narratives favorable to the Kremlin, U.S. prosecutors alleged on Wednesday.

An indictment unsealed in the Southern District of New York charged Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, both based in Moscow, with conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The indictment came as the Justice Department unveiled sprawling allegations accusing the Russian government of meddling in the 2024 U.S. elections.

The two defendants worked for RT, a media outlet formerly known as Russia Today that is funded and controlled by the Russian government, the indictment said.

Federal prosecutors said RT oversaw a series of “covert projects” that included funneling $10 million through a series of shell entities to a Tennessee-based company launched in 2023 that publishes videos on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and X, formerly known as Twitter.

“Many of the videos published by U.S. Company-1 contain commentary on events and issues in the United States, such as immigration, inflation, and other topics related to domestic and foreign policy,” the indictment said. “While the views expressed in the videos are not uniform, the subject matter and content of the videos are often consistent with the Government of Russia’s interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Government of Russia interests, such as its ongoing war in Ukraine.”

Though the company is not named in the indictment, prosecutors said that it describes itself as a “network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues” and features six commentators as its “talent.” Tenet Media describes itself using the same phrase on its website, and other details in the indictment align with the firm. Its website lists six right-wing personalities, including Dave Rubin, who has more than 2.4 million YouTube subscribers; Tim Pool, a podcast host with more than 1.3 million YouTube followers; and Benny Johnson, whose YouTube channel has nearly 2.4 million subscribers.",9/5/2024 4:41,llkz1l2,1f98831,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

Ducky181,"**This is a mature model (as evidenced by China's nationwide promotion), not the DUV model currently undergoing mass production testing (the lithography machine used to manufacture Huawei's latest mobile phone chips).Previous chip teardown reports have indicated that Huawei's chips were not manufactured using ASML lithography machines, or at least not exclusively using ASML's machines.**

I am not aware of any DUV lithography machines made by a Chinese company that are undergoing mass production testing for the critical layers in the 7nm node for SMIC, a manufacturing company that produces chips for Huawei. Since the leading DUV machine in China called the SMEE SSA800 does not have the overlay and alignment accuracy, specifically Single-Machine Overlay (SMO) to accommodate the requirements needed for self-aligned double patterning (SADP) and self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) for layers beyond M1 at the 7nm-5nm node.

**According to previously published information, all key components of EUV have already been mastered by Chinese research institutions or companies. They are now in the optimization and system testing phase. It may take another two to three years to achieve chip yields that meet production requirements.**

What key reports are you referring too? Since the technology within Extreme ultra violent lithography encompasses a broad spectrum of different technology levels. In terms of more specific measures, the most cutting edge technology I am aware of from China within the disciple of EUV is the creation of a four mirror optical configuration in 2022. While for the laser source, the institute of CIOMP's achieved a prototype using a CO2 MOPA laser prototype for laser produced plasma (LPP). Both these components were constructed in a highly controlled laboratory setting.

These technologies are decades behind companies and research institutions in the west who were recreating six-mirror configuration systems, and high-power pulsed CO2 laser/Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA) prototypes back in the very early 2000s. Even when a complete functioning prototype was created called the ASML 2004 alpha demo it still took nearly twenty years to transform it into a machine capable of mass production at a commercial scale called the EXE:3400C. In contrast, even today China has not demonstrated a machine equivalent to the alpha demo.

**Progress on EUV can be gauged by observing developments in Huawei's latest chips. If 3nm process chips appear in Huawei phones, it would indicate that China's EUV technology is ready for large-scale production.**

That is not correct. A complex integration of self aligning and various patterning techniques such as LELE and SADP called SALELE can achieve 3nm without EUV. It’s much more inferior compared to EUV, with very poor yield rates. It is nonetheless still viable.

With Snapchat it's clear that they have been too lazy to implement a regex safety check for some search terms, which is borderline criminal if you ask me, the platform is aimed at teenager and young folks.


There's similar things on telegram, which will proactively look up drug salesmen for you if there's even a hint of you looking for that, same on Instagram, you can string together something like [Cocaine] _+ , [London] and bam, you or your kid can order any kind of illegal and harmful substances with no further ado.


This can be relatively easily prevented by having the search queries being subject to a regex check(like when an app tells you your password must be so and so many chats, special chars).
This tells you that the apps implement such regex logic into password selection, or rather, the functionality is copy paste, included in some.libraries.
While the query checks against drugs and CP need to be self made, so the companies skip on that or do a very minimal job on this.

- The work Ofir Press and the group from Princeton do on LLM coding and capabilities benchmarks and evals is also very cool  [https://ofir.io/about/](https://ofir.io/about/) (although API costs might be high, idk)

- The work being done in applying DL to tabular data. Many datasets there are in the 10-100K instances and almost all research papers are easily reproducible with limited resources.

DatGeekDude,"If you're literally applying to 3-4 jobs per day every day, then I'm going to assume that you aren't building your application package specifically to the company or organization that you're applying to. Based on my assumption, here is my advice:

- Put all the potential companies you want to apply for into a list, then sort the list by priority (where you most want to work). For the top 10 companies, do research into the position, the company mission/vision, their strengths and weaknesses, maybe even what tools they use, etc. (do your OSINT) and build your application for each of those 10 companies based on your findings.

- Build a website and/or link to a code repo to show your work. Emphasis on the former - maybe blog about latest CVEs and add some technical research spin to it, post about your findings in your lab? Whatever works. Make it yours. Make yourself unique and stand out, go the extra mile.

- As much as possible, form your experience as: ""Action. Result."" I see a lot of things that you did here, but not a lot of results or metrics. What did you achieve with your actions? How did that benefit the company?

- Some of the items in your lists do not belong. Kali is not an offensive tool, its Debian preconfigured with tools, etc. I'm nitpicking here. Also, there are things that most cybersecurity folks aren't going to care about. Excel and such really don't need to be listed here.

- Depending on your region and who you're applying to, you might need to insert some keywords into your resume to get through initial screening. This isn't an issue where I'm from, so I don't have any experience to contribute here. Just listing it.

- Use LinkedIn and other in-person methods for networking, not just for job hunting. Having people who know, trust, and respect you at the place you're applying to is often half the battle. It's also something that the current generation just doesn't seem to be doing, so this might be the most important point here.

Hopefully some of that is helpful. I've had a ton of success using these points throughout my career. Good luck!",9/13/2024 20:03,lmzbwvy,1ff84y9,cybersecurity,t5_2u559,POSITIVE

The most straightforward path is to think of your Macs as big iPhones and use InTune (which still works as an MDM on Mac - just not as good as Jamf) to leverage MAM policies (sometimes called App Protection Policies, or APP!). 

I think [the real magic you're looking for is PIM](https://knowledge.sittadel.com/user-pim-eligibility-addition-work-instruction), which is a feature of EntraID - not windows per se - so you can still use it in your azure workloads via Macs.  This can pave the way for you to use JIT for privileged access.

For device hardening, start with requiring FileVault and measure compliance with InTune, and then spread to SIP and app sandboxing.  SIP is a seamless integration, but app sandboxing can be a little fiddly - ymmv in Mac's app sandbox.  Even though the Mac application of Conditional Access isn't feature complete, you can still require only trusted and compliant devices.

I'm familiar with but have not used personally Beyond Identity and Duo Security for device binding, but it has always seemed like more of a risk to availability than a gain for confidentiality and integrity - would love to know from other redditors what their experience has been.

The implementation of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is easier than Reinforcement Learning (RL), I mean all that is required, is to add components based on the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) describing the double pendulum to the loss function. Since the required equations are already known, I think PINNs would be a better choice. Also the fact that Reinforcement Learning requires a lot of epochs to show actual improvements.

>Did you not just say you used genetic algorithms? That's an optimization algorithm.

As I wrote in the post, no optimization algorithms are used for ""the simulation"".

> Should I be focusing on certs now, or wait until I've done the coursework?

Your priorities should be:

1. Not failing your coursework, as failing a class sets you back both in time and money.
2. Cultivating a relevant work history (i.e. any cybersecurity work, internships, cyber-adjacent employment, workstudy, etc.).
3. Attaining certifications as a distant ""as able"". These are not timeboxed; you can sit for these exams after you attain for your degree if needed.

I'm a proponent for continuous job hunting; look for roles that you want, roles that you feel unqualified for, roles that are in cybersecurity but not what you're wanting, roles that are cyber-adjacent, etc.

The worst case scenario is that you don't get a job you hadn't planned on applying for anyway. The best case is that you end up with a job in the professional domain much sooner than expected. Either way, you get a better handle on what the interview process is like, a better sense of your market value, and exercise the skills of the job hunt in a deliberate fashion.",9/9/2024 16:18,lmaof2u,1fcc309,cybersecurity,t5_2u559,NEUTRAL

Few firms had the ability or need or infrastructure to mine the data they were accumulating, so you mostly worked for the big boys. It was exciting to be at the forefront and yes, it was not just fun, but frequently a blast.

That is not where we are now, unfortunately. Most work is now built on previous work, improving rather than inventing. In a very bad analogy, it's like we tapped all the oil wells, so now we have to do fracking to extract extra energy. The promise and price of AI and ML is that they wind up finding kernels of insight for sure but remove much of the art in the process.

There were multiple images of radios (confirmed) fingerprint scanners for door security (unconfirmed, could be unrelated) cars (could be from radio explosions) and bikes (could be from radio explosions) along with videos of explosions (real, but unclear if they are from today or some other day or location).

The AP and BBC didn't report on anything above I marked as unconfirmed hence why I would trust their reporting on the solar panel as they clearly did some fact checking on which stories were provable.

StartledWatermelon,">everybody seemed to agree that BERT isn't a language model

How? The BERT paper literally calls the proposed alghorithm ""a language model"" at least dozen times.

A language model's goal is to learn joint probability distribution of a sequence (of words/tokens). BERT was trained on two objectives:

1. Prediciting masked tokens conditioned on surrounding tokens;

2. Predicting if two sequences appear in text sequentially in  a given order;

with both objectives explicitly requiring the model to learn joint conditional probabilities of tokens in a language.

After pre-training, BERT comes with a fully functional unembedding layer showing the token distribution probability over the current position in the input sequence. The task you mentioned is pretty trivial for it.

The thing is, the unembedding layer was often discarded in the course of fine-tuning to specific downstream tasks. Does it mean that the model was immediately uncapable of evaluating joint probability distributions over language sequences? I think it's not that straightforward. I think the more correct way is to say that the model got the ability, for instance to map said probability distributions to specific classes, if we're talking about classification.",7/20/2024 15:41,le3flh3,1e7pvlg,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

FarSide2688,"I’ve been doing AppSec for nearly 10 years and run AppSec for a large global bank, gone through many big vendor AppSec tools and to be honest I’m still pretty disappointed by all of them and a bit jaded. They either start as great niche tools but then buy a bunch of other crap products and bolt them on to push the whole eco system approach (but none of them actually work together, eg Snyk) or they just keep adding language support or other features that look great on a brochure but don’t improve the overall product or UX (eg Checkmarx). 

But the thing that sucks most for nearly all AppSec tools is poor reporting and findings management/workflow, and providing a true single pane of glass view (aka ASPM) across different capabilities that doesn’t care how it’s been integrated (SCM vs CI etc). I have auditors and risk teams crawling up my arse all day stressing over how exceptions are being managed and proving every release is being scanned and issues are being fixed or risk managed, but none of the vendors care about this shit because it doesn’t make for slick presales demos to executives. If someone can solve this problem properly then I, and every large regulated enterprise would buy it. Frankly the number of languages supported, false positive/negative rate, and super technological AI advanced features rate a distant second to this for me. And sadly tools like Defect Dojo and Nucleus that try to solve this  don’t do a great job of it either.

That's right, you won't be able to do this via OpenCL due to lack of functionality in AMD and NVIDIA OpenCL. (this is an example of vendor adoption friction I was talking about)

However, with AdaptiveCpp the same binary can seamlessly use OpenCL/CUDA/ROCm/OpenMP backends depending on what is available.

>Bottom line I expect that a program I write can run like it was OpenGL, or Vulkan - just run - no specific code bloat. Don't see how sycl allows it. But maybe I mistaken.

This works with AdaptiveCpp. It embeds LLVM IR, which it then lowers at runtime to SPIR-V, amdgcn, CUDA PTX etc depending on what is needed.

>The point is that for vast majority of the kernels 1.2 is enough. I think [Pytorch OpenCL backend](https://github.com/artyom-beilis/pytorch_dlprim) I develop still can use 1.1.

ramen_poodle_soup,"> you seem to be too simpleminded to grasp the concept that killing one innocent person for every terrorist is fucking evil 

By that metric almost every instance of urban combat is “fucking evil”. Fighting ISIS in Mosul was fucking evil, totally. Regardless of that, the pager/radio incident didn’t kill anywhere *near* the rate of one innocent person per target, so I guess they’re all good then. 

Also if you really want to compare WWII to now (which isn’t really productive for a lot of reasons, primarily that WWII wasn’t pretty much a single theater of operations that revolved around urban combat, it was spread out around the world and civilian casualties varied by theater and mission), roughly 40% of Germany’s casualties were estimated to be civilians. For the allied bombing raids or any action that involved urban combat, that rate skyrocketed.

Interpreting benchmarks and people’s experiences is hard because of how memory is managed, for a single program, either you have enough memory and it runs fine, or the performance takes an obvious and huge hit, and 8GB *is* fine for the vast majority of programs. But if your system runs out of physical memory, then performance when changing tasks is what gets tanked, and benchmarks etc. rarely measure that. That could be something as simple as it being slow to move between a browser, EndNote and Word. My experience has also been that there is often scope creep, you think you’ll only do light Office and browsing, but invariably end up needing to do more with it, for whatever reason. If you plan to use the laptop for any reasonable length of time, 16GB is quite important even for anticipated light productivity.",8/4/2024 21:16,lgif950,1ek211m,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

Watch them do everything they can to intimidate voters, purge the rolls, make false claims about immigrants voting, and whatever other technicalities.

If I was buy a put spread, buying a $14 put and selling a $10 put (for an expiration of January 2025) would cost around $240 and have a max profit of $400. If you are open to a little more risk, just sell a lower put. Buying a $14 put, and selling a $7.5 put would cost around $350, and have a max potential profit of $650.

Lets be real for a lot of people art is just painting a pretty picture. Things do not have to have meaning or purpose for people to consume them and even if it were required something 100% artificial can have meaning for you the same way a piece of art is not limited to the interpretation of the author himself but the enjoyment and message the consumer derived from it. You could look at a really good ai generated novel (in a hypothetical future) and it could have a good story, wouldbuilding, pacing and characters. The lack of a human author wouldnt make it less enjoyable to read would it? In fact you can probably even be happy it doesnt have an author in some cases (my god made in abyss would be so much more enjoyable if i could not question why the author puts small children in those clothes and situations) The same way you can use a knife without it being personally crafted by a blacksmith with passion. Dont get me wrong i hate the current state of AI (my god tech bros and corporations trying to shove it everywhere are a pain)  and see there are huge potential social and economic problems with its further development if we dont heavily change our societal structure in the eventual case of it not plateauing as it currently seems to be doing, but i felt like ranting about it because i see the ""ai x is and will be souless because it just mixes preexisting things"" (as if humans dont do the same) and it honestly annoys me and your comment reminded me about it even if its not the same.",9/19/2024 3:09,lnubvll,1fk1z2m,ChatGPT,t5_7hqomg,NEUTRAL

Sweaty-Science-2454,"I have 8 years of experience in data science. A Masters in Analytics.

I was laid off in December 2023, and then unfortunately my dad got sick and ended up dying. I have only been looking in earnest for the past few months. But I've come across a lot of fake jobs in that timespan.

Early on I had one offer. Stopped my job search to accept. Then it was rescinded before I could start. They never got approval from upper management for the role.

I've since made it to final rounds 4x. Out of the 4 times, 3 times its been a fake job and they have no actually made a hire. The last time is TBD as I am currently on round 4 (after being told there would only be 3 interviews, then offer stage).

My question is, how do you keep the motivation to keep going. I feel so discouraged and hopeless. My mental health is really suffering.

I hate live coding interviews but I've done 3 of them now. Each time it really rachets up my anxiety. I get through about 50% of them. But I really don't want more practice and really wish this whole nightmare just could be over. But I feel as if I am still 6-12 months out from finding a job at this point.

What are other experiencing? What is a reasonable timeline in this market?

undyau,"This is from the Wikipedia entry on the topic - I stopped the cut at the point where the article goes technology specific (the ""vaults"" it describes are not used by many tokenization solutions):

> **Tokenization**, when applied to data security, is the process of substituting a sensitive [data element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_element) with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a [token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token), that has no intrinsic or exploitable meaning or value. The token is a reference (i.e. identifier) that maps back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system. The mapping from original data to a token uses methods that render tokens infeasible to reverse in the absence of the tokenization system, for example using tokens created from [random numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation).[^(\[3\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security)#cite_note-3) A one-way cryptographic function is used to convert the original data into tokens, making it difficult to recreate the original data without obtaining entry to the tokenization system's resources.

For more context: I am currently working as a trained software developer (in case you are not familiar with Germany’s apprenticeship system: you work and get trained at a company for the job you want, in my case software developer, and every couple weeks have school at a specialized school for in my case it jobs where you learn the basics) and in my freetime I’m doing a bachelors degree in cyber security at a online university, but the quality of the taught content is pretty damn low and I feel like I don’t learn much. So if I finish it it would only be to get some more € on my paycheck and not to really learn much. But that is not why I want to do this, because I want to learn more about cyber security to be able to work in that field. So my question is if instead of paying 200€ a month for the next 4 years (takes longer than normal university because it’s parttime due to work besides it) for university should I rather save that money and do certifications from it? 

If yes, Recommendations for certifications and what else I can do to learn more and what I can do that I can put on my cv to get a job in cybersecurity are welcome as well :)

1. the origin of the modern education system born out of the industrial revolution wasn't designed to produce well-rounded people, it was designed to produce trainable factory workers with a basic level of knowledge. There hasn't been much change from that underpinning structure.


 2. Defunding education is by design as a populace lacking higher-order thinking skills (analysis, evaluation, creation) tend to be easier to manipulate. But even those who promote it are still limited by factors outside education (see: taxes, politics, etc)

I think the problem, in a broad sense, is that the idea of ""ceding"" these bumpy spots to professionals has become so ubiquitous. People see no need to learn anything that they aren't getting paid to do.

Back when, there was often no one to really ""call"" for that help. Computer stores and help lines existed, but they were pretty pricey. So as a pimple faced teenager, you and your like minded friends were either going to solve it, or it didn't get solved. All that circumstance, along with as you rightly say, just a higher general amount of curiosity and DIY spirit, lead to a crucible where kids really learned stuff about technology.

Even outside of the tech conversation, all of that struggle is farmed out now. You call a handy man to hang your tv. You go to the dealership to get your oil changed.

littlest_dragon,"24 years ago I had somehow managed to get a job as a junior corporate consultant, despite being a high school dropout and my only qualifications being six months of call center work and a 20h evening course in programming.

A year into my job I got a call from a headhunter and ended up having business lunch with some manager from a different company who offered me a great job, which I declined for various reasons.

A few months later one of my bosses drove me home from some company event and I told him the story. He asked me why I declined and I said, out of loyalty, you guys gave me a chance, sent me to multiple courses and generally have always treated me well.

He grew a bit angry with me and told me that if that was true, then I was an idiot. “Never have any shred of loyalty to your employer! If there’s a chance that you can get a better deal somewhere else, leave. Because we’re not loyal to you, we pay you and treat you well, because you generate profit for us. The moment you stop generating profit, or we think we can get a better deal, we’ll fire you without hesitating!”",9/11/2024 6:00,lmkd1dj,1fdfxjg,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

laughingwalls,"If they care too much about a certification I'd view it as a red flag. It tells me they probably don't have competent people.

That being said certifications don't hurt a resume and are a minor plus. They are easy thing to point out if someone asks about your proficiency in some specific skill. ""Do you have any exposure to X? Well I did a certificate in X. ""

  
The thing to get is if your at a org with a large swat of qualified technical people (places that hire MS CS/Stats/Engineering/Econometrics/Math/Physics) that did a thesis of sorts. There is a general understanding that no one knows everything and people have different skillsets that they bring to the table.  Furthermore, if your  team is highly educated there is a general understanding that people can pick up things as they go along.

Certs are a good way to show that you have some exposure to a topic that a specific job may want even if you haven't used specific skillset in your previous role. Yes they aren't substitute for an actual project. 

As an example, lets say that you are a  data scientist with 5 years of experience and a masters degree in stats from 2018. Lets say your previous role involved mostly regression models/logistic regression projects in R or SAS  for a bank, and now your interviewing for a role where your going to be probably going building decision trees and XG boost ML models in Python for similar products at another firm. Having a certificate for ML in python, might become the deciding factor for why you get the role over someone  who has  ML/python experience, but doesn't have model building experience.",5/28/2024 23:34,l63kf33,1d2kg7x,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

DeafHeretic,"Yes, but this particular corp, did this for almost a decade, paying the staffing agencies more per/hr (or salary/etc., depending on the contract with the agency - there were 2-4 agencies depending on the year) - e.g., a contractor would get paid $50/hr, and the agency would get paid $75-$100/hr for that employee (the agency did pretty much nothing onsite, provided payroll/benefits). In practice, this cost more to the corp than if they hired the contractor as a ""regular"" employee.

The N. American division of the corp (one of the largest/oldest corps in the world) did this because the European HQ (the main HQ) wanted to restrict the number of ""regular"" employees - so the NA HQ got around this limitation. Towards the end, contractors started having limits placed on how long they could continuously work at the corp, and then 18-24 months before they could be rehired.

But yes, it was almost solely contractors that got laid off, and no notice was made in the news because no notice was required to be given the state because of the small size of the agencies, and the layoffs were spread over multiple agencies - so the corp got the added benefit of no bad press.

Much of this kind of hiring practices - ""perma-temps"" is pretty much against IRS rules, and there have been lawsuits/etc. against it (e.g., Microsoft) where large fines and settlements were paid.

The corp where I worked, was well known among those who worked there, for going thru these cycles of hiring and then every 8-10 years laying the contractors off.

hojahs,"This is a really insightful lesson from Sutton the GOAT.


But for me it kind of highlights a philosophical divide between Industry/Big Tech and Academia/philosophy. If I want to create a model that simply has the *best performance possible* so that I can embed it into my product and go make a bunch of money, then clearly this ""brute force"" approach of throwing more compute and data at the problem and removing inductive biases is going to put me at the current cutting edge.


But the origin of ""Artificial Intelligence"" as a field was to answer questions like: What is Intelligence, really? What is Learning, really? How do our brains work? Is it possible to create a non-human General Intelligence that excels at multiple tasks in multiple environments? NOT to beat SOTA performance at a single, narrow task (or even a handful of tasks).


For this purist take on Artificial Intelligence (which does not care about Big Tech and its monetization of everything), LLMs and other ""brute force"" techniques are much less interesting. For example, Yann LeCun referred to LLM as another [offramp](https://x.com/ylecun/status/1621805604900585472?t=7U455nmOvNLB0mWgEZQf-Q&s=19) on the road to AI.

In the **tech industry**, this happens more often than you'd think, particularly in situations where:

* **Data is limited** or not suited for complex modeling.
* **Results are needed quickly**, and building a robust model would take too long.
* The **decision's impact** doesn’t warrant the time or complexity of advanced models (e.g., minor feature adjustments).

This is where you are off the rails wrong. The opposite is true. Any good deal with value will make life worse when you reject it. That is exactly the way life works. You can't apply this principle to anything else in life.

They showed that single layer linear networks (DLinear and NLinear) outperforms very complex transformers for long-term time series forecasting. No activation, just a single layer of linear transform. And in come cases they reduced the error by 25-50% compared to transformers. Many further papers confirmed this.

Furthermore, very recent [""An Analysis of Linear Time Series Forecasting Models"" W. Toner, L. Darlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14587), showed that even those models can be simplified.

the more us poors get choked out, they won't wakeup and realize what they've done, they'll just get more mad at us for being so stupid, and aim even higher at their fellow brother billionaires.

dfphd,">Data scientists don’t really seem to be scientists

I agree with this, and even the people that are doing research in data science are not often doing actual ""science"" research as muchs they're doing engineering research. Source: am (traditional) engineering PhD. 

Data scientists are business employees, not academics. And everything else in your post seems to be missing that. 

>Everyone on this sub downplays the importance of math and rigorous coursework, as do recruiters, 

People downplay the importance of math and rigorous coursework *past a certain point*. That is, if you want to focus on getting the most out your career - any career - then there's a balance of skillsets that you need to bring to the table. The reason we emphasize this a lot in data science is because there are a TON of people with strong technical skills and comparably very few people with strong ""everything else"" skills. 

It's not that we're saying ""hey, don't even bother with learning statistics"". What we're saying is that most people reach a point of technical skillset where the incremental value on becoming technical stronger has a lower ROI than becoming stronger everywhere else. And that's partly because it becomes so much harder to keep becoming more technical, and partly because it's sooooo much easier to just learn the bare minimum of soft skills to become well-rounded enough.

That doesn't mean that there is no value in becoming more technical - many people do. It's just that the share of people for whom that equation is ROI positive is much smaller - it's basically limited to the people who are both technically brilliant and also beyond limited in their soft skills. Which, again, especially with the incidence of neurodivergence in STEM fields, is not *that* rare, but it's going to be a smaller share of professionals.

As to what recruiters/hiring managers are looking for: we want people who can both do the necessary technical work while also functioning in a work environment that is comprised of and led by people. Which means you need to know/learn how to deal with people productively. That's pretty much it.

>and the only thing that matters is work experience

If you took a lot of rigorous classes, and did a lot of great research *and you can't translate that into workplace productivity*, then yeah - you're not a good candidate. 

This is like a RB running a 4.35 at the combine and then averaging 2.3 yards in the NFL. I don't care what you did in a lab - I care what you do in the job that I'm hiring you to do. Again - data scientists are business employees, not scientists.

>I do wonder when datascience will be completely inundated with MBAs then, who have soft skills in spades and **can probably learn the basic technical skills on their own anyway.** 

Again, you are mistaking ""limited value beyond a baseline"" with ""zero value"". 

I forgot more math in one summer than an MBA grad will have known in their entire lives. And I'm not an extremely technical person these days. I have worked with a bunch of MBA grads in my 10 years in industry. Some of them are extremely smart, but as it related to technical skills not only are they well below the baseline expectation you'd have of a data scientists - they also have next to none of the building blocks you'd need to learn this stuff on your own.

I learn most machine learning on my own after graduating with a PhD in OR - and that's because I had learned more statistics than I care to remember + optimization + discrete math + linear algebra. The average MBA grad will be lucky to have learned linear regression at a surface level - literally ""draw a line through these dots"" level shit. 

They don't know matrices; if they learned calculus ever, they forgot all about it by now. The general concept of programming is completely foreign to them. 

Again, I would imagine generally speaking a freshman in engineering/natural sciences/math/computer science/etc. would all already know more about the technical prereqs a data scientist would be expected to have than the average MBA grad. And I'm not talking about the technical prereqs that you see on paper - I'm talking about the prereqs that you'd need to have to actually do the average day to day job of a data scientist.",5/28/2024 16:31,l61lzh1,1d05mqt,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEGATIVE

Reddactor,"Ok, I have 3 projects:  


1) GLaDOS: the goal is to build the Character from the Portal game franchise.  




As that needs a murderous AI, that is sentient, that means some serious modifications to LLMs, TTS and ASR, and vision models. Also, a robotics platform of course.  


The pricing is GitHub stars. This project was once the top trending repo in the world once, and a few time for just Python.


https://github.com/dnhkng/GlaDOS




2) RYS:  to make GLaDOS more intelligent, I had to analyse how LLMs work (peek into the black box).


 
That led me to develop a new method called RYS (the paper on the method is half written). With it, I got the top spot on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard. 


Pricing is free, but TBH, I want to work more on this, so I'm looking for collaboration. Would love to work with people from Meta in particular, or independent researchers like J. Carmack, because I grew up playing Doom 😊


https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard (dnhkng/RYS-XLarge)




3) Infinimol.  As my background is Organic Chemistry (did optogenetic brain-computer interface research back in the day), I have been applying Transformer models to Drug Discovery with good results.




As I'm in Europe, start-up funding is nearly impossible for this topic though! If you are not affiliated with a university, it's very hard to get grants. And Private Equity/VCs usually understands Biotech OR SaaS/AI, but never both.  They are hesitant to invest in a market they don't understand, and pretty much no one know both AI and Biotech together. If you know of a good fit for us, please PM me!


So, looking for funding and support!




We have a team and have already invested about 150k. I hope my projects above give some indication of our technical capabilities.

Thin-Government-1230,"It sounds like you're in a tough spot, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed given the circumstances. Transitioning from school to a high-responsibility role without support is incredibly challenging. Here are a few thoughts that might help:

# Short-Term Solutions:

1. **Break Down Tasks**: Start by breaking down your responsibilities into smaller, manageable tasks. This will make them less daunting and help you make steady progress.
2. **Online Communities**: Join online forums, such as Stack Overflow, Reddit, or even LinkedIn groups. These can be invaluable for getting quick advice and support from other professionals in the field.
3. **Self-Learning**: Utilize online resources like Coursera, edX, and YouTube to fill in knowledge gaps. There are great tutorials and courses on data engineering, database management, and data visualization tools.
4. **Mentorship Programs**: Look into external mentorship programs. Organizations like Data Science Central or local tech meetups might connect you with experienced professionals who can offer guidance.

# Long-Term Considerations:

1. **Skill Development**: Focus on developing skills that align with your interests within the data realm. Even if your current job isn’t ideal, it can be a stepping stone.
2. **Networking**: Network within your company and industry. Sometimes, opportunities and insights come from unexpected places.
3. **Job Market**: Keep an eye on the job market. While it's tough right now, having an updated resume and LinkedIn profile ready can help you jump on opportunities when they arise.

# Personal Well-Being:

1. **Balance**: Make sure to maintain a work-life balance. Engage in hobbies, spend time with friends, or even consider therapy if you're feeling particularly down.
2. **Reflection**: Reflect on what you enjoy about data science. Is there a specific area that excites you? Pursue that passion, even if it means small projects or side gigs.

# Career Transition:

1. **Consider Gradual Change**: If you truly feel data science isn’t for you, think about gradually transitioning to another field. This could involve taking courses in a different area, like software development, product management, or even something completely outside of tech.
2. **Explore Other Interests**: If the idea of farming in Appalachia genuinely appeals to you, start small. Try gardening, volunteering at a local farm, or taking weekend trips to rural areas to see if it’s a sustainable and fulfilling lifestyle for you.

# Community Support:

1. **Reddit**: Continue to engage with communities like this one. Sharing your experiences and hearing others' stories can be incredibly validating and offer new perspectives.
2. **Professional Groups**: Join professional groups or societies related to data science or your areas of interest. They often have resources and support networks that can help you navigate your career.

Switching jobs with less than a year of experience can be tricky, but it's not unheard of. The key is to frame it positively: you're seeking opportunities that better align with your skills and career goals. As for walking into the woods, it's a romantic notion, but remember there are ways to find fulfillment and happiness without completely disconnecting from society.

Ultimately, you have to prioritize your well-being and career satisfaction. Take small steps towards change and don’t hesitate to seek support when you need it.",7/30/2024 13:37,lfnavca,1ef51yt,datascience,t5_2sptq,POSITIVE

Kharuz_Aluz,"Just saying it is a terror attack doesn't make it one.

Let's have an intellectual debate, how is this action illegal?

You allowed to attack a military objections even in the presence of civilians:

>>The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations. -[Article 51(7) of the Additional protocols](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-51)

So it doesn't matter where the attack occured, rather is it excessive or targets protected persons. And the answer to both is that the Israeli attacks does not target protected person and isn't excessive. As per Article 51(4, 5) & 52 of the additional protocols.

By your logic former [ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(law)#:~:text=Under%20international%20humanitarian%20law%20and,excessive%22%20in%20relation%20to%20(b).) is a terrorist apologist. 

>>Under international humanitarian law and the Rome Statute, the death of civilians during an armed conflict, no matter how grave and regrettable, does not in itself constitute a war crime. International humanitarian law and the Rome Statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives,[12] even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is an intentional attack directed against civilians (principle of distinction) (Article 8(2)(b)(i)) or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage (principle of proportionality) (Article 8(2)(b)(iv)).

>>Article 8(2)(b)(iv) criminalizes:
Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated;
Article 8(2)(b)(iv) draws on the principles in Article 51(5)(b) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, but restricts the criminal prohibition to cases that are ""clearly"" excessive. The application of Article 8(2)(b)(iv) requires, inter alia, an assessment of:
(a) the anticipated civilian damage or injury;
(b) the anticipated military advantage;
(c) and whether (a) was ""clearly excessive"" in relation to (b).",9/18/2024 15:34,lnqxn6i,1fjl2zg,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

ResidentPositive4122,"Sorry for the wall of text, but this is a topic of interest for me and I hope it helps.

First, it depends on what you mean by RAG. RAG can be thought of both as a concept and a particular implementation - say lib.rag(data). And it's important to figure out what you mean first, because the answers diverge in each case. 

RAG as a concept predates LLMs. Simple search *is* RAG. When you send a query to google, they take that query, *retrieve* something from many indexes (say websites, images and scipub) and then *generate* an answer for you. Here's the top 10 links, here's the top 10 images and here's the top 10 papers related to your query. You've just applied RAG! even though the ""generation"" part wasn't LLM driven (or, in the case of google, parts of the generation - info cards - could be LM driven).

Now moving into the LLM world, a lot more is also RAG than just popular_library.RAG(). Every context manager, even a simple one that handles previous replies, *is* RAG. Say you have a simple context manager that handles chat history. You *retrieve* something from the memory (even as simple as get_newest(5)), you append it to the context of the LLM and you *generate* an answer based on that. Still RAG. 

If you're talking about poorly_architected_library.RAGButWithWeirdAbstractionsPlease(TEMPLATE_1_BUT_NOT_THAT_ONE), then yes there are a lot of variations. But those are implementation details, and they mostly deal with how you perform the retrieval. You can do simple term search, you could do embeddings (most popular), you could do graph searches, you can re-rank them, you can do in-between generations and so on. If you're looking for alternative to those, then you'll probably have to read the literature and see what works and what doesn't, in what context, and more importantly if you can find it - what didn't work for their particular use-case. That's where real-world experience with real-data helps, and where teams that do this day in and day out have some experience with. Some also post blogs, so you might want to check them out. There's some great content on code retrieval for example, where people have used CTAGs, graphs, and all kinds of software sugar to make retrieval work better. 

At the end of the day, the only way to find the best RAG strategy for your case is to have healthy pipelines and good observation & validation tools. There isn't a cookie-cutter already abstracted by someone else, works on every case solution out there. And again, it's because RAG is a concept, not a thing you call from a library. You only should abstract it at the end of your project, after you've validated every aspect of your pipeline. 

So the short answer is - there are no alternatives to the concept of RAG, there are plenty of alternatives to poorly designed abstractions. You just have to go implement them, test them and see what works for your specific case.

----

Now to address the most often given answer - just add more tokens! or the 1M context gang. That's not an answer, it's a crutch. No matter how large of a context you can dump, you will still, 99.99999% of the time want to do RAG. Let me give some examples:

A) you want a coding assistant to answer the query ""what arguments should I pass to cv.draw_circle?"". Sure, you could just dump the entire opencv doc into the context and call it a day, but what's the point? First it's extremely wasteful, and second, you risk it getting distracted, hallucinate a bunch of unrelated stuff and so on. No-one in their right mind would do that. Humans don't do that. When you had to rtfm, you'd go to the chapters section, figure out where draw_circle was and read that section, or maybe a few more related ones. But never the entire damn book. 

B) say you're a law firm. You want to answer questions about a case. You would never just dump every case in the context and call it a day, because of data contamination. You'd have stuff from client_A potentially leaking into an answer for client_B. And that's a big no-no. So then you'd have to filter the documents based on user_id. And bam! you just did RAG :)

C) for the foreseeable future, no matter how big the context gets, and no matter how fast compute gets, just dumping everything into the context will not be able to work at ""internet"" scales. Google doesn't do that today, they have shards, and they have indexes, and they retrieve stuff from them based on a lot of factors. So no, just having a large context doesn't mean you don't do RAG. You still do, at a concept level.",7/27/2024 9:12,lf5y4sg,1edbg0h,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

It *can* be very stressful and I definitely think it's made me a lot more suspicious in general, but any career is going to have some impact on you so meh.  What do they even mean ""sitting behind a screen for hours"" like it's a big cyber security job? That's almost all jobs now?  Do they not realize how completely ubiquitous computer are now?  I would not believe anyone that said they intentionally failed classes because they are boring.  That person is at best deeply, perhaps unsalvageably stupid , why would you waste money like that to intentionally fail a class?  This person is most likely a liar who couldn't keep up and is trying to save face.  Most classes are to come degree boring and most bachelor's programs are to some degree boring.  It's preparing you for a career, which will most certainly not be what you want to spend your time doing, hence why you are paid to do it.  Please note that security isn't really an entry level position, to be good at any of it you need experience with the technologies you want to specialize in real world environments.  Knowing how enterprises actually work, understanding how fucked and duct taped together most place's tech is, and knowing how to deal with insane people are incredibly useful skills in all cybersec roles I've been in contact with.  That said, SOC and IR work is has been a one way ticket to burn out city, I wish I would have stuck to my original plan and just gone in GRC from the start.  As to the lawyer bit, that's also a high stress, often boring job.  AND it's something that can easily overlap with cybersec, I have a friend that was a security analyst while he was getting his JD and now he does breach related stuff for businesses when the inevitable happens.  It's admittedly a primarily non-technical overlap but it does exist.  If you're really just genuinely interested in cyber security, figure out where you would like to specialize and learn about that area in your free time.  If you're not very interested, but just like working in tech or want that paycheck, I would suggest getting an AWS cert like CSA or Azure equivalent and getting Solutions Architect job. They pay pretty well and seem (from the outside anyway) to be a bit less stressful and require less effort on the tech treadmill.  My personal experience is that red teaming seems to be both much more involved and the job market a lot tighter, so keep that in mind.  I don't what country you're in, but in the US, it's pretty normal to not declare a major right off the rip or to change it down the line.  If you're mostly doing Gen EDs and intro classes to find what you like (that will count towards elective requirements).  Anyway, my advice is to lie to your family until you're out in university and just do what you think will make you happy.  As Kasual\_ said, making last life choices based on what other people want for is a recipe for disaster.

TheSupaBloopa,"> I don't really know if it's common or not for American cities to have apartment buildings, but if it is - why do people prefer to live in houses & if not - why are apartment buildings not built in cities?

Typically apartment refers to a rented housing unit in a larger shared building rather than something you own, and a condominium (condo) is a version that you can own. Condos are much more rare, so the dense housing in our cities is mostly all rented, meaning there's a substantial financial incentive to buy a house somewhere else instead of staying in a dense central neighborhood. And of the existing condos and apartments, the majority of them are one and two bedroom units designed for young people with roommates, poor people, and no one with a family. Units beyond 3 bedrooms are exceedingly rare, so anyone starting a family is expected to leave the city for the suburbs. 

Beyond that, most of North America has an extreme lack of ""middle housing"" types that are far more common in the EU. Think townhomes, row houses, etc. 50+ years ago, people in power decided that detached single family homes were the best choice for everyone, and outside of a small handful of cities, zoning laws forbid anything else from being built. Some cities have over 80% of their land area devoted strictly to single family zoning. It's less of a general preference or popular choice and more of the only real option available for many many people.",9/10/2024 6:48,lmei9pf,1fd0d3o,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

I'm more into backend and ops, so figured, why not? 

as for it as industry, not everything is directly related to cybersecurity, but there’s a security compliance quota for projects to be met. I just focus on picking up from others and learning as I go.

Hezbollah and the other muslim radicals are terrorist organizations. But Israel has proven to be no better. Not by 1% better.

This is pure terrorist action by Israel against unknown recipients. The most obvious conclusion here is that Israel is actively trying to initiate a large conflict in the area, that will inevitably suck USA and Europe in it. 

I live in Eastern Europe and would consider myself to be an educated and positive person.

Isogash,"It's been proposed and tried many, many times, but the model suffers from significant drawbacks that you might not anticipate.

Firstly, battery swap process is actually hard to fully automate reliably, you are basically building a full on mini-factory to swap out these bulky batteries. Design, building, running and maintaining it is ridiculously expensive and adds a significant cost.

It's also slower than you'd think. Removing a well-secured, heavy battery, moving it around and then securing the new battery, complete with all necessary calibration and testing steps ends up taking at least 10 minutes.

It's not as reliable as charging; there's a higher chance that the replacement station fails to complete the process or breaks down and requires manual intervention, and when it does, it leaves your car undriveable in the interim.

It also turns out to not really be more efficient or cheaper than just fast-charging your car battery from an on-site battery. Running and maintaining the replacement station takes energy, so the potential efficiency gains just end up being offset.

There are also practical economic problems with the ownership and rental of batteries that you swap, and how you would stop people returning batteries they damaged for fresh ones, or compensate someone for giving them a faulty battery by accident. It just comes out to more cost for everyone involved to manage this properly.

And finally, it turns out that EV drivers actually like trickle charging at off-peak hours when their car is parked, because it's cheap and convenient. They don't use public chargers anywhere near as often as people use gas stations, and for long journeys they are now used to planning stops ahead.",9/5/2024 10:51,llly5ak,1f8vidz,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

There have been far more than 2 EV chargers built, thousands have been built. But after they are built, you have to go through paperwork and apply for the money. Then an inspector will come and check if everything is in compliance, once that is done, money would be issued months if not a year later

So it isn't that only 2 were built, it is that only so far at the time of the reporting 2 passed the rigorous requirements and qualified. And it isn't that 7.2 billion is wasted, the money is just lying there, you can't just go out there and buy a private yacht with the money, things don't work that way. Part of why everything is so expensive for government to do is precisely because of the huge amount of bureaucracy that goes into any form of spending.

And not sure what Michigan water has to do with anything, as with the yacht, you can't just take money from 1 thing and put it in another. On top of that, it is more of a state issue than a federal one. But federal give the state money for it:

jpfed,"There are so many little things that people (as problem solvers) do that may have involved some conscious or explicit thought at first, but become automated over time. And you can't take for granted that any given LLM will remember to do these little things, or know how to do them. Without knowing that this is what I am doing, in order to (for example) plan a larger action I might call to mind the prerequisites to taking that action and insert smaller actions that satisfy those prerequisites into my plan. I might think ""man, I could go for a sandwich right now"", without verbally or consciously noting that the materials for that sandwich are downstairs and I am upstairs; seemingly automatically, intermediate actions like descending the stairs are inserted into my action plan.

It seems likely that LLMs could benefit from using many, many ""thought tokens"" that silently (but still through the verbal medium) create or enact these small steps before they explicitly emit ""speech tokens"" that interact with the outside world (e.g. a user). But there's probably a still better way, something that does not require going through this ""verbal bottleneck"". The verbally-capable aspects of my brain are presumably not thinking ""now move the left foot"" as I descend those stairs to make and then eat my sandwich. Ideally, there would be some way for a model to distill verbal insights into something that navigates the manifold of the problem space more directly.

But the fact that planning can be so easy and automatic for us, *and* the fact that decoder-based LLMs seem so fluent, may make it harder to get the sort of accurate sense of their abilities and limitations that makes it possible for us to usefully incorporate them into our action plans.",8/30/2024 10:52,lknh8aw,1f4prqb,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

What I mean is you can learn about how LLMs are being used in the industry, how you can augment the current workflow using them (querying document, generating synthetic data have become easier), try building applications involving LLMs. I think 2-3 months are enough to do this, no need to spend 6 months. But if you are learning LLMs and if you don't know the foundation, then also learn about transformers, attention etc. 

Regarding LLMs being overhyped, imo it is overhyped in the sense that industry is considering it as silver bullet (as if we can solve all the problems just by using an LLM and as if classical models are dead!). I don't think all the expectations from LLMs are going to be fulfilled. But LLMs do have novel applications and they will definitely be leveraged in the coming time.

Overhang0376,"(Speaking for US, not UK)

I can't say how others will see it, but I can tell you that I'm *strongly* of the position that if someone has paid their debt, and genuinely changed, deserves the opportunity to prove it.

It's a risk, but I think it's of a societal importance to let people who have gone through the justice system to fit back in, and become reacclimated. It helps to keep crime low by giving ex-felons the opportunity to change. Not to mention that people who know how bad things can get, tend to be *way* more motivated to avoid going back to that! When I worked in fast food, I worked with dudes who had done years in prison who would show up *hours* early to their shift in order to make sure they wouldn't be late. They did it because they didn't want any excuse to risk parole, or to anger the manager. They were committed to doing things right, they just had some dirt in their past.

For Cybersecurity specifically, a lot of people who are in senior positions now have committed crimes when they were younger - it's tempting, and I'm not going to pretend I never thought about it. The main difference is that some of them/us never got caught, or did it before it was a crime. I think that anyone who would hold your criminal record against you is a moron and a hypocrite - it really comes down to how good their hiring staff is.",9/19/2024 14:22,lnwfyxy,1fjy6z3,cybersecurity,t5_2u559,POSITIVE

Step 2: Israel backs out and a ceasefire happens and the hostages get returned and we don't get a regional war.  Or Israel doesn't back out and runs out of various types of weapons such as those on the third page of this filing - https://x.com/SenSanders/status/1836429523258130494?t=4Dbd96fxzwSJoId_LbOPeQ&s=19 - and they are unable to continue the war for more than a short time longer and are definitely unable to expand the war on new fronts as they clearly wish to.

Step 3: if they secure alternate arms shipments and escalate their war on new fronts we sanction them until they stop or even declare a no fly zone as we did in places like Libya and Eastern Europe and use our force to end the conflict

I'm just fascinated how my stance of ""killing civilians is bad"" is being pushed on as you look to carve out exceptions for where its fine.  If the pentagon and everyone inside is a legal military target then the plane that hit it on 9/11 was not terrorism.  Are you really going to make that argument seriously?

I don't hate him just as I don't hate jeff bezos or mark zuckerberg, I have no need to hate him because his nonsense doesn't harm of affect me.

The aggregator you propose is something we have tried about a year ago, it didn't give nice results but is a very good intuition. Also it wasn't so easy to compute as it is not just the SVD, but there is an additional constraint to have J+D non conflicting.  
UPGrad is actually very similar to that, you can formulate it as finding a matrix H, such that all entries of JH\^T are positive and |J-H| is minimize with the Frobenius norm. Then the decision is simply the average of the rows of H. If J is non conflicting, then JJ\^T is non-negative and J-J=0, so the output is the average of the rows of J. Otherwise, we will go in the direction proportional to H\^T1 which will lead to a change in the function (by plugging in the order 1 Taylor expansion) -JH\^T1, which clearly is non-positive (so we locally decrease all objectives), and since H is the closest to J, then we do this is some ""maximal sense"".",9/10/2024 7:35,lmemab9,1fbvuhs,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

maru11,"Some points that make it bad for me:

1. You’re carrying something you don’t need: While driving fully electric: the whole ICE power train, while the battery is empty: the whole battery/emotor/regenerative breaking system. -> “useless weight”.

My car is rated WLPT for 80km electric range, so realistic like 60 which means it’s battery is empty quite a lot or you’re carrying the ICE around in that time. Usually they try to run full electric in cities without ICE on.

2. They usually don’t fast charge. While on the tour, you’ll never charge it once empty except for overnights. If you can’t charge at home, you’ll probably never do it. Why should you if you can fuel up in 5min but charging 80km would take you 2-3hrs?

3. They are sluggish. If you’re on full electric and do a kick down it takes a bit until the power from ICE comes in. (Think the time of start / stop automatic).

Usually each part on its own feels “underpowered”. On my car it can drive fully electric up to 130km/h but overtaking etc it basically always starts the ICE. Doing kick down while battery is empty also just doesn’t feel right, probably because of the extra weight of the emotor stuff.

4. Combination between ICE and electric engine seems quite bad. I’ve read this about a few manufacturers and I have this as well that in slow speeds switching between ICE/e motor feels bad as they do some weird stuff with the transmission. It just feels clunky, hard to explain for me tbh.

5. Breaking is similar: as it’s a hybrid the regenerative breaking systems are quite small / can’t regenerate a lot of power in a small amount of time. Switching between regenerative breaking and real breaks feels bad, but I believe this is most likely also due to the transmission. Mine doesn’t have a system to keep the break discs in check, I believe, which is making thinks a bit worse in case you really need them.

6. Using the electric only mode, makes you really think if it’s a good idea to let the ICE jump in with a cold engine at 130km/h on the highway. Even if they use specific oil that performs better when the engine is cold. Same goes for always deep draining the battery (which happens basically anytime, but not charging it often).

7. You’re not saving on maintenance parts like a real EV, because you still have this super complex ICE power train & transmission. 

8. At least on mine, but I believe on all hybrids, there is no real “one pedal driving” which makes driving some of these EVs where it is available so much smoother once you get used to it.

As an American, the country and set of corporations I am most worried about abusing my data in ways that don't serve my own best interests is the government and corporations *here in the US*, not China.

I live in the US, what the US government or US corporations can do with my personal data impacts me way more then what anybody in China can: If I say something anti China it's not like China is going to fly police across the planet and arrest me in the US. people here in the US HAVE been arrested or harassed [for being critical of local police](https://kansasreflector.com/2023/08/11/police-stage-chilling-raid-on-marion-county-newspaper-seizing-computers-records-and-cellphones/) or from [spying on people's digital records to see if they got an abortion in states where that is no longer legal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/07/03/abortion-data-privacy-prosecution/)

Similarly, Insurance companies [spying on people via drones](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/home-insurance-aerial-images-37a18b16) to find excuses to drop coverage or their online records to sniff out if they have prexisting medical issues is something I need to worry about from US corporations, not Chinese ones. Or, as another example, see [this article](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/data-brokers-trump-tech-spying-privacy-threat-1234897098/) Which had Rolling Stone Reports track people down to their exact location with a precision of just a few feet via ""anonymized"" advertising data from Google, Facebook, etc

If you're gonna argue that Chinese corporations can collect data and sell it to US ones, well guess what, it works in reverse: Google, Facebook, etc sell your personal data to China, so banning Tiktok etc won't actually do anything to prevent China from getting your data. 

If you and everybody else really cared about protecting people's data, we'd pass robust privacy protections that aren't app specific but are universal, including in regards to domestic corporations like Google and Facebook, which would allow people to decline the collection of their data by ALL apps, programs, and services, without being blocked from using said things if you decline, and banning the Third Party Doctrine so every time a company wants to share your data to another one, they have to explictly ask your permission for each instance, and regardless of if you've said yes already earlier in the chain of it being shared.

OneCryptographer,"I think your original premise is incorrect

> As far as I know a language model in the original sense is a model that is able to predict the probability of a sequence in a given language.

To the best of my understanding many ""classical"" language models did not define the language model objective by being able to predict a sequence. 

In the more classical setting typically one is interested in the distribution of words (or tokens) to understand the likelihood of a sequence of words (or tokens) occurring. Its not the same thing as what you've stated.",7/20/2024 8:33,le217cb,1e7pvlg,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEGATIVE

thegrandabysss,"Well, ""clearing 15k"" means ~30k before taxes, or 360 a year.  Sure, the president pulls more in, and a handful of specializations or whatever, but for a relatively inconsequential job in the film industry I'm happy with it. I'm also not a harvard law grad, so why worry about what they're making. 

Look, whatever you think your time is worth, there's a number for everyone that makes sense. Some people would look at taking home (clearing, after taxes) 1k a week as being worth a 60 hour weekly grind. Some people might want 2k, or 5k a week. The number is not really relevant, you seem to have high standards, good for you. 

My post was merely a response to the idea that a 60 hour workweek is unsustainable. It isn't. Many people (here, in America and Canada, let alone the hard workers in Asia) work those hours for 5-10 years, or longer. When you're 25, 30, and you've always been poor, you look at an opportunity to make more money in one year than you've ever seen in your life and, guess what, you take it. They ask you back another year, you keep doing it. It's punishing, yes, but you retire by 40 and live a life of leisure after.

Did the Harvard law grad have an easier life? I don't know. Maybe. That's not my point and that's not productive to think about. In my circumstance, and in the circumstances of many people who aren't Harvard law grads or computer engineers for mega corporations, a 60 hour workweek can be a ticket to an easy life if you save it and invest it in a diversified way.",9/9/2024 7:02,lm8qku0,1fcbvk0,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

They might get a small amount of revenue with this approach but are exchanging that for a tarnished reputation and a lost opportunity to establish credibility within the industry.  And given that we’re talking about security, credibility is everything.

Case in point:  On Wednesday I noticed an issue affecting a large energy company.  The only contact I had was a former employee.  I reached out and he passed my info to someone in their SOC.  Within hours that person leaves me a VM.  

I call him back and describe the context of my visibility (high functioning honeypot that I operate), and that I’ve observed about a million attempts to compromise customer accounts with a couple hundred that were successful.

He shares that this has been an ongoing issue they have been struggling with for a year and thus the timing of our notification is much appreciated.  I also share my theories that I believe this is a precursor attack to identify targets who are now validated customers of this company so that they can be subjected to smishing/vishing with the “if you don’t pay your bill in the next hour, we’re shutting off your power” scam MO.

This makes him remember that they did have an employee recently report getting one of those calls (they are a customer as well) and now he can see the total picture of what’s going on.  Needless to say, he was very appreciative.  I offer to send him the details on ALL of the compromised accounts.  

At no point did I even mention what services I offer that might be able to help with all of this, but bottom-line, I’ve established a good relationship and am confident I will be willingly given the opportunity to do this.

This all went down like this because when he got my info he checked around to his boss and others and one of them was very familiar with my track record and quickly knew I wasn’t some extortionist scum sales guy.

Woootdafuuu,"It as intelligence but it as a data-fitting training problem, you can kinda address it through a prompting but sometimes fine-tuning might be needed to get to the core other wise training data bias will override logic: The goal is to teach the model not to predict the answer in the dataset but to understand the reasoning behind it.

For example, when you teach the model to predict based on training data answers, it goes like this:

You tell the AI, “When you see the words ‘Sally goes to the market,’ your answer should be ‘shopping.’” You feed it a bunch of data that says:

Sally goes to the market = shopping
Sally goes to the market = shopping

Now the AI has learned to say “shopping,” but it doesn’t understand the reasoning. So if you switch the keyword but keep it close enough, it won’t recognize the change. Instead, it would try to predict the answer from the training data for “Sally goes to the market,” which is “shopping.”

When the user says “Sally goes to the beach,” the AI tries to predict based on the training data and says, “Oh, I know the answer is shopping.” But notice now it says “beach,” not “market.”

The goal is to train the AI to recognize the change and understand cause and effect. So even though it only sees “Sally goes to the market = shopping” in its training data, it will pay attention to the change. The AI will then say, “Well, this is similar to the question in my training data that says ‘Sally goes to the market = shopping.’ However, this time it says ‘beach.’”

By doing this enough in fine-tuning, you eventually help the model grasp the concept, meaning it learns to apply this understanding to other situations. But it doesn’t end there. Remember, we need to teach the model cause and effect, including the implications of changing “market” to “beach.”

You do this by training the model to predict the steps that lead to an answer, not just the closest words that match the training data. So now when you say “Sally goes to the beach,” you get: “This is similar to ‘Sally goes to the market,’ however, the statement says ‘beach.’ What are the implications of this? What if ‘Sally goes to the beach’ equals swimming or playing in the sand?",9/17/2024 13:57,lnkkx5m,1fiwlxl,ChatGPT,t5_7hqomg,NEUTRAL

He was given access to everything and no one really knows what he'd do but I think he could do almost anything. Anything urgent, critical, difficult, risky, his teammates would escalate to him. 

I was in a meeting where a teammate called him into a project that he was not in the loop. He was asking seemingly silly questions so the vendor made assumptions based on that. The vendor got upset, treated him very rudely, and it would appear that the vendor needed all kinds of technical things that would need a network guy, systems guy, firewall guy, security team, and no one can help, what a disaster, they're going to escalate to the CTO, whatever. In an instant, I witnessed a beautiful Uno reverse I'll never forget. The cybersecurity engineer was all caught up after the vendor's rant and said he can do all those things now, shared his screen, configured it all, melted their faces, and gave them what was needed and it appeared they switched sides of the fence, now the cybersecurity engineer needed things from the vendor and they didn't have the technical expertise. I was on the edge of my seat bracing for what would happen next, so what did he do to get back at the vendor?? He was understanding, patient, kind, and helped them fill their technical gaps. That's when I knew he was entirely off his rockers. Any sane person filled with hatred would have used that opportunity to retaliate. I wondered if he was even human.

We would have meetings where I would give him full control of my machine, so I'm paying attention and learning from him, but what is he actually talking about and teaching me? Be compassionate to myself? Kindness? Positive parenting? Everyone is doing their best? Look at a person's actions, don't judge their character? Do what resonates with my core? What the actual fuck. At first, it would fuck me up for days. I can't explain. Then he said not to listen to him because he's just thinking out loud?? Lunacy. No one thinks that way. Do they?? He got me fucked up.

masterfultechgeek,"Causal Inference is not a ""missing data"" problem so much as it's an unsupervised learning problem. 

No one has a sign that they hold up which says ""the outcome would be Y1 with treatment W1 and Y2 with treatment W2""



The work around is to essentially compare otherwise similar observations that got W1 to those who got W2 and to find the expected difference in Y1 vs Y2 and to use that as an estimate of the ""counterfactual""

This gets tricky though because ""similar"" isn't necessarily well defined. Also at the same time, not all observations have lots of good comparison points. 

So you end up needing to do MANY MANY MANY adjustments.

Significant-Analyst9,"Greetings to my favorite subreddit! Fellow data enthusiast here, and I am hoping to get your advice on long term career goals at my employer.

**My background**

My career started in accounting. Then pivoted to a variety of supply chain roles as an analyst. My roots are entrenched in Microsoft Products. Started as an excel monkey, then SQL neanderthal, followed up by Power BI human. Self-taught through most of it and as smart as stackoverflow allows me to be. Pursuing a MS in Data Science to get more grounded STEM knowledge and better combine with my domain knowledge.

**Courseload thus far and outlook**

-Bachelors in Accounting

-Udemy courses on Power BI, SQL, DAX, etc

-Dataquest modules for Python

-Pursuing MS in Data Science at Eastern University

**My employer**

Leading manufacturing of durable juvenile good in the US(strollers, car seats, high chairs, etc.). While we are technically an international company, we are very siloed and operate as a small-medium sized business. I am a data science team of 1. No real IT team in the US besides a 3rd party service that helps with day to day tasks. I am the data wrangler, cleaner and presenter from start to finish. I am the Power BI admin/developer and analyst for our business unit. Launched the reporting suite when I started with the organization 4 years ago. Before that launch, everyone was excel jockeying very disparate data sources often looking at the same number in multiple places.

**Infrastructure(image showing flow in the post)**

Limited to Microsoft 365 solutions. I do have a lot of leeway when it comes to implementing new software. I just need to present the options to management outlining the cost/benefit analysis. Since I am a team of 1, It can’t be an infrastructure that requires multiple touch points. Emphasis on automation.

**The goal from my perspective**

I have gotten about as far as I can with low code solutions. Power BI is both our ETL and data storage solution which works for small datasets but will not scale well when data starts growing.

**Wants:**

-ETL Process that is separate from Power BI. Needs to be easy to alter when data delivery methods change

-Data storage solution that is scalable for growth and easy to access for a remote friendly company.

-Foundation for more advanced data science practices(machine learning, neural networks, subject matter covered in later coursework.

**As an aside**, sometimes I receive advice to just change jobs to a more data driven organization. Not an option that I am willing to pursue. On a personal level, this is exactly the type of employer you want to have while raising a family. I am compensated very well and the benefits to my family and well above average. My wife and I are expected our 2nd child this year and I will have the luxury of having 12 week paid paternity.",7/26/2024 14:48,lf1hw8i,1e951vk,datascience,t5_2sptq,POSITIVE

I think the advantages to use plotly dash was the greater level of flexibility with branding and design for our organisation but as your may be aware ui design is basically a full job in itself. We didn’t have the capability to use any other software and we needed greater level of control when plotting our model results. I wouldn’t advise someone to do a dashboard in python or R unless they are somewhat comfortable with containerising or have access to posit.

I think the bottom line is greater flexibility and control but it’s more work to productionise it. If your manager isn’t willing to give you direction and the time i would advise against it show how much more time it’ll take and maybe write up some pros n cons within your work for your boss.

However, this approach has limitations. If you have two gradients that are *conflicting* (they have a negative inner product), simply summing them can result in an update vector that is conflicting with one of the two gradients. So summing the losses and making a step of gradient descent can lead to an *increase* of one of the losses.

We avoid this phenomenon by using the information from the Jacobian, and making sure that the update is always beneficial to all of the losses.

We illustrate this exact phenomenon in Figure 1 of the paper: here, A\_Mean is averaging the rows of the Jacobian matrix, so that's equivalent to computing the gradient of the average of the losses.",9/8/2024 12:49,lm3tofa,1fbvuhs,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

How about Eli Whitney that laid the foundation for the American Industrial Revolution?  Carver who changed how the world would grow crops?  Fulton who's steamboats revolutionized travel and trade? Stanford, Crocker, Hopkind, Vanderbilt that laid rail across America, revolutionizing travel and trade again.  Edison and Tesla that brought electricity.  Bell who brought communications.  Wright Brothers that brought flight (and another revolution).  Ford who brought the automobile that transformed every city around the world.  
Pauling who brought the understanding of molecular biology.  Einstine that brought a fundamental sea change of physics.  Salk who erridicated polio.  Fermi who opened the doors for nuclear power?


Less than 20 names, and any one of them has brought more to changing America and the world than Elon ever will.

Reusable rockets are cool and a boon to space exploration but they aren't a sea change of capability.  Teslas aren't the only EV, nor the only self driving car.

Twitter, for all of its previous flaws, was a powerful source of real time information and was used by protest movements. Authoritarian governments always want to control the flow of information. Through that lens their purchase and destruction of Twitter has been a massive success. Besides what’s a few billion dollars to the Russians and the Saudis?

I'd recommend researching what positions there are, what skills they require. Then decide which ones make sense with your skills and expertise, and which ones you might want to develop into (the two are separate).

There's tons of material (videos, articles) on exactly these questions on the internet, plus an unending number of courses. Doing your research on these will help you ask more defined questions and people will be able to help you in a better way.

I'd also challenge your statement by saying: no, you will not be job-ready and the jobs/companies will also not be waiting for you. 

I'm saying this with all the possible love (and I'm _not_ saying that to make you feel bad ♥️). In my opinion, you might first want to figure out what kinds of job you want to do. Then you might consider internships as a way to gain some working experience in that field or an adjacent field. After that you will still be a (potential) junior and you will have to make a transition from uni to the business life - if you haven't worked in a company before it usually takes about a year to fully acclimatise to the way things are done in a company setting.

[deleted],"The cost surface in (ordinary) linear regression is always convex. Maybe with regularization it might become non-convex, in which case I would probably initialize with the global minimum solution to the non-regularized problem.

For non-linear models, how to initialize the parameters is a subject of active research (maybe less active recently, I'm not so sure). There are some basic rules, like they can't start at zero (no gradients then) and that the weights along different paths need to start at different values (so they learn different stuff), so usually you start by sampling them from some random distribution. Which distribution to use depends on what kind of layer you're initializiang. For example in pytorch a Conv2D layer gets initialized with a Kaiming Uniform distribution.

I'm not sure most people think too much about parameter initialization though. Sample them randomly to ensure non-zero gradients and asymmetry (or more like, the library you're using does this for you so just don't even worry about it), use (instance/group/batch) normalization layers to keep everything inside the model under control, and if you're concerned about local minima then fiddle with the learning rate schedule and/or model architecture and/or batch size and/or get more data rather than worrying about parameter init.",8/29/2024 19:42,lkk0nix,1f47xui,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

Since this is a discussion forum and not a promotional forum, I'm going to assume that you're OK with some constructive feedback, so here goes --

1. It will lend more credence to your findings if you show statistically significant improvement over strong baseline APO methods; TextGrad, DSPy, RLPrompt, and maybe a really simple baseline such as random bootstrapping from 5-10 heuristically chosen seed prompts.  
2. On the subject of statistical significance, 60 Q/A pairs (80/20 train/val) is a small validation set, it will be pretty easy to get fooled by randomness. I also can't find anywhere in the article where you describe the domain of the questions; domain-agnostic improvement is very important, since you're claiming your method is general.

Silly-Tradition9460,"They are all different types of awful:

Tik Tok: I actually kind of like it when I have the app trained to just show me funny absurdist shit and music. But the overall vibe is that it isn’t even social media, just media in its lowest quality form basically. The second I veer off into discourse type posts? App actually makes me paranoid and depressed. Feels like endless surveillance and I’m not even talking about the CCP. More like a way to police each other. Everything anyone ever does constantly being questioned and the basis for criticism. Even more light hearted posts roasting people’s fashion and shit it’s like just stop why.

Instagram: Probably the least harmful for me individually, the only one that somewhat retains the “add your friends” vibe. I somehow haven’t seen the extreme toxicity of instagram reels I’ve heard so much about. However the app induces so many eye rolls. The “culture” of the app so to speak tries to create this air of exclusivity but it’s just ads for poorly made products and feels like gentrification: the app basically with the whole insta restaurant aesthetic taking off here etc. The vibe of the app is like you have some friends and without realizing you end up at a rooftop bar that caters to digital nomads and they are all trying to flex but it’s all just the same shit that is like Tik Tok with less personality.

Reddit: Honestly my least favorite one, but it is good for having an outlet of discussion for specific topics. Broadly though, it has adopted the worst aspects of social media. It’s the endless reposts of instagram meets the discourse of tik tok, except it’s a different type of smugness on Reddit. Reddit tends to reward whinging more so you get a lot of misery pits, and this is by far the worst for reposted content and obvious bait. Posts with a map of Crimea saying “sorry if I’m uneducated, just curious, which country does this belong to?” type shit. This app is bar none the worst I’ve seen for pricks with some horrible ulterior motive trying to weaponize social media to push some horrible thing while being so transparently smug about it. But the current best way to find dedicated discussion for any topic you want.

Twitter: I’ve never actually posted on this app, just browsed. Was a fun way for famous people and news organizations to communicate with everyone else but obviously it’s just a Nazi hellhole now. I want nothing to do with it. 

Facebook: I’m maybe too young for its heyday, I did have one at one point and it was alright for a moment, all people you are actually friends with and good spirited shit posts. But I deleted years ago. Terrible app that is basically just a way to find out everyone you’re related to is an actual Nazi to an extent you didn’t realize before, and the shit that gets posted here isn’t even trying to be clever or anything.",9/18/2024 12:02,lnpyfa6,1fjlnun,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

shellacr,"I feel like all those kinds of articles are written for maximizing clicks. Controversy is good for the media. Particularly the NYT has (almost) never had a good thing to say about Tesla, even in the early days of Model S before Elon was openly fash. Even this article about a *single* person’s tire experience is a bit ridiculous.  

What I’d want to see is statistics on the buyers and their political leanings and why they bought the truck. I would guess most are just into tech and want something more green like myself. 

As for public perception I don’t think online is representative of the real world. I’ve only gotten positive reactions to the truck or more commonly, indifference. I’m in New Orleans, a liberal city, so if I were driving around say with MAGA stickers everywhere I may (deservingly) get a few middle fingers. I could be wrong though, there is a tendency for people to be polite to strangers. 

To be fair to your point, I do know a few Tesla owners who have left because of Elon drama. One person i know IRL, the other two online. Myself I would switch of something better came along. I’d also be compelled to switch if someone ran an *actual* organized boycott campaign, with tangible goals and demands, such as let Tesla workers unionize. I’m not a fan of a haphazard hand wavy boycotts in what are IMO otherwise great vehicles.

NuclearHeterodoxy,"One of the common byproducts of thorium reactors is U233, which can be used for military purposes.  The US designed at least one CSA for a nuclear weapon that had U233 instead of U235 or plutonium (see #6 here [https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16137450.pdf](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16137450.pdf) ), although we don't know which specific warhead it was.  

There are actually some benefits that U233 has over.  It combines some of the best (for military purposes) characteristics of U235 and plutonium, and doesn't have the weird allotrope issues plutonium has.  The gamma rays are a problem, but not an unsolvable one.  

The biggest issues with U233 are only really issues if you already have a plutonium- or U235-based arsenal: having to completely redo all the handling safety procedures and processes (which are mostly based on alphas now, not gammas), and possibly having to abandon certain types of delivery vehicles or launchers (e.g., you don't want gammas in the tight confines of a submarine).  But if you start building an arsenal with U233 from the beginning, you wouldn't have to worry about making disruptive changes because you would  design around that from the get-go.",9/14/2024 4:12,ln1dmaw,1faqsc2,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

altoidsjedi,"In a similar boat to you. My combinations are:

- My MacBook Pro M1 Pro, which is great for INFERENCING in portable, local projects and experiments. Gives me implementing most things in PyTorch, MLX, CoreML, etc. Training models done entirely on rented cloud GPUs. 

- Sub-$400 X86-based (AMD) Mini PC (They're ridiculously capable devices for relativity cheap) that I can connect to an external GPU (in the range of NVIDIA 3060 or greater via PCIE, Occulink, or USB4/Thunderbolt. Throughput limited to x4 PCIE rather than X16, but still great for inferencing. Would like to experiment with fine-tuning a small model on it locally. Rented cloud GPUs are still more or less necessary for training / fine-tuning. 

- Raspberry Pi 5 for testing out low-power inferencing of models converted to run on M.2 NPU like Coral Edge or Hailo-8 / Hailo-8L. 


In an ideal world, I'd love to have the money to build a 4x 4090 setup, but the costs are hard to justify when you can rent cloud GPU for much cheaper and without the headaches. 

Non-unified architecture Laptop GPUs are kind of the world of both worlds. They do not have high bandwidth access to VRAM, instead using the system RAM which is slower on a magnitude of 10 or more. 

The Macs and upcoming AMD Ryzen releases are great due to unified memory architecture that makes ram available to GPU elements in a manner more similar to the multi-channel, high throughput of discrete GPU. That is just not a thing with current non-Mac consumer laptops.   

So in short, I think you either want to get a Mac and do your training on the cloud and inferencing locally. Or you want to get an X-86 based PC (Laptop, mini PC, whatever), and hook it up to an external GPU. 

If I lost all of stuff and had to start from scratch, I would go for the Mac and allocate the rest of my budget to renting cloud GPU for training runs.",7/19/2024 20:47,ldzjshd,1e7a306,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,POSITIVE

jpfed,"As far as I know, the literature calls this ""semantic segmentation"" or ""semantic chunking"", with the former preferred by image/video folks and the latter being preferred by RAG folks. There is a spiritual similarity here with inferring constituent trees or dependency trees but I don't think the literature has exploited that.

If you don't mind me blathering off the cuff... imagine you had a BERT-style model that could fit the whole text in its context window. Imagine the final attention layer, and for the moment, let's pretend it's just one head. Look at the softmax(QK') attention matrix (I'm going to call this A; even though the conventional A matrix doesn't include the softmax, the softmax will be handy for us because it makes all the numbers positive and within a well-defined scale). For a conversation rigidly structured into completely unrelated topics, A would look like it had square blocks of non-zero values near the diagonal and zeros outside of these blocks.

A real conversation might be messier, both because of how conversations work and because the attention mechanism is unlikely to produce those perfectly-structured block matrices. So let's imagine there are flecks and light clouds of noise on the otherwise-block-diagonal attention matrix. Finally, topics over time in real conversation might have a sort of ""fractal"" quality to their relatedness; if a conversation has a ""math"" part and a ""arranging lunch"" part, the ""math"" part might be further subdivided into parts that center on different topics within math.

To segment or chunk this conversation entails finding boundaries for those blocks automatically, despite those complications. Any prospective boundary divides the attention matrix into four regions: the upper left block (the first topic), the lower right block (the second topic), the upper right block (how the understanding/embedding of the first topic would be revised by the inclusion of the second), and the lower left block (how second topic's understanding/embedding is enriched by the first topic).

If we just set out to find one boundary, my guess would be that we want to minimize the sum of the values in the upper right and lower left regions- call that our loss. To make this process easier, we can feel free to take that attention matrix and add it to its own transpose to get a symmetric matrix (call it S for symmetric sum). Minimizing the sum of cross-topic interactions with S will give the same answer as with the original A matrix.

Let's make a ""loss"" matrix L, the same size and shape as A and S. L will hold a 2D form of the cumulative sum; that is, L(i,j) = L(i-1,j) + L(i,j-1). Except we want the cumulative sum not to proceed from the top left going down and to the right, but from the bottom left going up and to the right, so that 2D cumsum formula needs to change to reflect that, like L(i,j) = L(i-1,j)+L(i,j+1) ... (probably... which one is plus and which is minus depends on how the dimensions are ordered. Anyway). The point is that the cumulative sums on the main diagonal of L can be used as the basis for finding all segment boundaries.

Extract the main diagonal of L into a vector b (for ""badness""). Almost done. Find the position of the minimum of b to get the position of the first topic boundary. Then, recursively split b at the position of that topic boundary into two smaller vectors and find their minima to get the next-best chunk boundary, etc.

If you can't fit the whole text in your context window, then you don't have access to the whole A matrix that, hypothetically, you would get if you could. But maybe your sliding windows can help you build up a daigonally-stripey estimate of what A looks like for some region within a certain distance of the main diagonal.",9/2/2024 15:11,ll5nel7,1f72wzq,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

exhentai_user,"Addressing that point:

That's always seemed a little weird to me, tbh. Like, I get that pedophiles who hurt children are monsters more than most people do (thanks dad for being a fucking monster), but, I also don't think it is actually their fault they are attracted to minors, and if there is not an actual minor who is in any way being harmed by it, why is it considered wrong?

Picture of an actual child - absolutely and unquestionably morally fucked. A child is incapable of a level of consent needed for that and sexualizing them takes advantage of or even promotes and enacts direct harm on them.

Picture of a character that is 100% fictional - I mean... It's gross, but if no actual human was harmed by it, then it just seems like a puritanical argument to lump it into the same category as actual child harm.

I'm curious what the moral framework used to make that law is, because it doesn't seem to be about protecting children, it seems to be about punishing unwanted members of society (who have a particularly unfortunate sexual attraction, but have they actually done something wrong if they never actually hurt a child or seek out images of real child harm?)

I'm into some weird ass fetishes (Post history will show vore, for instance), and just because I like drawings and RP of people swallowing people whole doesn't mean I condone murder or want to murder someone, and if I don't murder someone nor engage in consumption of actual murder footage, is it fair to say that the drawn images of fantasy sexual swallowing are tantamount to actually killing someone? I don't think so. But if a video was out there of someone actually murdering someone by say feeding them to a giant snake or a shark or something, that would be fucked up, and I wouldn't feel comfortable seeking that out nor seeing it, because it promotes actual harm of real people.

It’s tragic anytime it happens, and if this did occur I’m sorry for that girl and her family, but it is an unfortunate fact of war, Israel has had its fair share of civilian deaths and hezbollah and Hamas are actually targeting them, but I seem to only hear complaints about Israel when it is hypothetical civilians from collateral damage but no complaints about the other side when they’re actively targeting civilians and children.",9/18/2024 5:44,lnoysdq,1fj3o3x,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

Refusalz,"The answer is ""Yes""

You can't really stop an employee from utilizing public networks on company devices without implementing extreme measures, however best IT Security practices dictate that you must implement certain measures incase an employee does connect to malicious networks.

Protection measures can include:

* MFA
* VPN
* Antivirus
* ZTNA
* End User Training

Its all about mitigation / prevention. If your network gets compromised you as the IT security lead cant just throw your hands up and say ""welp its not my fault they connected to a malicious network""

Ask the question to someone trying to sell cybersecurity services to your company, I guarantee you there answer will never be ""Thats not our responsibility if your employee connects to a malicious network""

> Potential Ozone Depletion From Satellite Demise During Atmospheric Reentry in the Era of Mega-Constellations

>With ongoing plans for many constellations of small satellites, the number of objects orbiting the Earth is expected to continue increasing in the foreseeable future. At the end of service life, satellites are disposed into the atmosphere, burning up during the process and generating aluminum oxides, which are known to accelerate ozone depletion. The environmental impacts from the reentry of satellites are currently poorly understood. This paper investigates the oxidation process of the satellite's aluminum content during atmospheric reentry utilizing atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the population of reentering satellites in 2022 caused a 29.5% increase of aluminum in the atmosphere above the natural level, resulting in around 17 metric tons of aluminum oxides injected into the mesosphere. The byproducts generated by the reentry of satellites in a future scenario where mega-constellations come to fruition can reach over 360 metric tons per year. As aluminum oxide nanoparticles may remain in the atmosphere for decades, they can cause significant ozone depletion.",9/8/2024 8:23,lm30qbj,1fbfmvo,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

My objective is to estimate the realistic probability of life evolving to a human-like level of intelligence, considering the vast array of conditions that must be met. I would like you to calculate the number of potentially intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, based on our current scientific understanding of the prerequisites for life. Please account for all known conditions that influence the emergence of complex life.

Here are the essential conditions for the development of life complexity, as currently understood by science:

1. The planet must have an efficient carbon dioxide (CO2) cycle to regulate the climate.
2. The planet needs active geotectonics to recycle materials and regulate the greenhouse effect.
3. The planet must have the right size, structure, and elemental composition to support life.
4. The distance between the planet and its host star must fall within a habitable range (circumstellar habitable zone).
5. The planet needs a large moon to stabilize its rotation and regulate its climate.
6. The planet must have an appropriate axial tilt to support seasonal changes conducive to life development.
7. The planet requires an optimal amount of water to sustain complex ecosystems.
8. The atmosphere must have the correct composition of gases to support advanced life.
9. The planet requires a complex, layered core with the right composition to generate a magnetic field, protecting the surface from harmful cosmic radiation.
10. The planet must have conditions that allow for lightning and fire, which are essential for certain biochemical processes.
11. The presence of continents, oceans, and tectonic plates is crucial for sustaining dynamic environments and biodiversity.
12. The star system needs large gas giants, like Jupiter, to shield the planet from frequent comet and asteroid impacts.
13. The star itself must be of the right size, brightness, intensity, and spectral type to provide stable conditions for life to develop.
14. The star must have a sufficiently long lifespan to allow life to evolve from simple organisms to advanced intelligence.
15. The star system must be located in the right region of the galaxy, avoiding areas with excessive cosmic radiation or frequent star formation.
16. The star should have a strong magnetic field to protect the planetary system from cosmic and stellar radiation.
17. The distance to neighboring stars must be appropriate, preventing disruptive gravitational interactions.
18. The overall age of the universe must be considered.

You are encouraged to introduce any additional conditions that might be necessary for the emergence and evolution of complex life, based on contemporary scientific theories.",9/17/2024 12:29,lnk72rs,1fixwru,ChatGPT,t5_7hqomg,NEUTRAL

romacopia,"These hypotheticals are disconnected from the claims I actually made. I did not claim democrats are universally correct, just that they're correct about the economic reality behind social programs. They also come up with some absolutely ridiculous and poorly thought out policies and claims like the idea that paying off everyone's student loans with 0 plan for reducing future loans would be economically viable or claiming that puberty blockers have no risk of serious side effects. Both of those are party line ideas that observed reality does not support. The republican platform is that ad nauseum - reflecting truth far less accurately. This isn't black and white, but it certainly isn't perfectly grey either.

We should obviously train LLMs to be as accurate as possible. That process will inevitably lead to left wing bias so long as right wing politics continues to be devoid of data-driven policymaking. I think that's likely what lead to the discrepancy in OP's data on LLM value judgements up there. Hard-coding them to regurgitate party talking points would make it worse for no reason and I don't think I ever implied that I might think otherwise. Again, not black and white, not perfectly grey.

If you don't think it's right to try to align with reality as closely as possible, I disagree in my personal opinion.

No one can say what you should do - its your life. however, there are different ways of framing this problem. For example, there have historically been way more software engineering positions than data scientist positions. In several companies, the ratio will be 5-10 engr : 1 DS. 

>If I continue with data science, will I realistically find a junior job in that field after graduation?  
Again, no one can read the future, but the general concenus seems to be the future of junior DS is rather bleak. general CS is bleak at the moment too, but its hard to say which is worse

>If I don’t succeed in landing a data science job, will having a degree in data science limit my opportunities in other areas like software engineering or other tech fields?

The most common problem is:

""Today, we have a process to do X that requires either a bunch of people to do it, or requires some people who are really important to spend too much time doing it. Also, it takes too long. Also, we don't do it very well because it's too hard to do consistently and we don't have good tools for doing it. We want someone to build AI that does that"". 

AI = ML, Stats, OR, heuristics, logic, whatever. 

So it could be forecasting, setting inventory levels, setting prices, adjusting prices, predicting price elasticity, optimizing allocation of inventory, diagnosing outages, have a GenAI customer support bot, etc.

So it is mostly aligned with your Example 1 and 4. 

There is a LOT of Example 2, but as you said that's normally what analysts do.

There is some Example 3, but you have to very quickly go from ""here is some data"" to ""ok what are you planning to do with it?"".

That said, anyone can sue anyone for any reason, that doesn't mean the suit will be successful, and its basically free to sue someone using tax payer money (aka money that isn't yours). A decent lawyer could probably get this dismissed citing the fact that it was on the dark web which is basically the internet, so it was publicly available already. There is the famous case of a movie star or something suing over a google earth picture (or something like that) of their house which caused the picture to go from a few hundred to 100's of millions of views cause of the suit, basically by suing the city is just going to draw more attention to it then already existed.

Also, depending on what was compromised this could make it worse for the city cause if that hack got CI and undercover info (as it said police reports so who knows what else), that is worth some real $$$ depending on who and what is involved.

But yes, we do import a lot of corn...but how bout wheat? Not so much. The think about those two is they go hand in hand here. They are rotated crops that help the soil for each other. So one is necessary for the other unless the farmer wants to add everything back to the soil themselves. Doubtful, that loses money.

Mysterious-Rent7233,">Lying, gaslighting, selling drugs, and spreading conspiracy theories are all forms of human intelligence....It's not what we're seeking in ""general intelligence"". So even AGI proponents are not seeking general intelligence

That's a weird argument. AGI proponents don't want to make a machine fundamentally incapable of doing those things due to gaps in inference processing. They want to make a machine that does not do those things because it uses its inferencing to determine that they are harmful. I'd bet a fair number of them WOULD want the machine to tell white lies, or sell marijuana, or spread ""pro-social"" conspiracy theories under narrow utilitarian circumstances. And others would want them to do it as soon as they are told to do so no questions asked.

I actually think is you who is making a magical argument along the lines of flat-eartherism.

If some far future civilization replaced your brain with a silicon-based machine that generated the identical inputs and outputs as your real brain, would you say that that other brain is not ""generally intelligent?""

How is proposing such a thing as a (long-term) goal of science ""equivalent of ""real scientific efforts toward proving the earth is flat.""

I feel like a glorified secritary that is good with data and now won a lottery. But even working long hours and learning on the weekends can not keep up with it.

I just want to quit and hide, but on the other hand I have my ideas (I am very creative) and get butterflies with each task I get, and want to get good and faster at it. But the pressure is huge as I have almost 10 years of data experience and they somehow see me as a senior although I clearly express all my short commings (especially when it comes to coding, all SW used are prity much new to me, etc.).

And my 10 years experience realisticlly are mostly Excel, some SQL and some ML (my personal free time projects) and problem solving. But all your comments and advice, mutual fears and axienty stoped me from quiting this job I wanted to get for so long.

Like before seeing this post I was ready to quit and hide. I was ready to say, hey you tried, but you always be just a donkey with some Excel confidence. I am curious, love data, have some great ideas. I will be a good data scientist some day, I just need more time to learn and grow!

Cloudflare operates in Brazil and just needs to configure and isolate the traffic, which they do for other sites/countries, and then the ISPs can easily block it.

This X access is just temporary, and X/Brazil knows this. If X/Musk did this on purpose, it suggests they spent time/resources (no small feat) to switch providers to Cloudflare to circumvent the ban for a week or so.

two_bit_hack,"My advice: Take initiative and don’t wait for instructions from your boss. As the only cybersecurity engineer in your organization, your role involves more than just reacting to incidents - it requires proactively identifying and managing risks. Focus on learning industry best practices and actively seek to identify risks and vulnerabilities within the organization. When you identify a risk, present it to leadership and other departments clearly and concisely. Explain the potential impact and the importance of addressing it. Your aim is to inform and persuade, not to simply demand action. **Maintain detailed records of your communications and decisions**. If there’s pushback or if leadership decides to accept a risk, get their explicit acknowledgment in writing. This documentation not only protects you but also ensures that there is a clear record of decisions made.

For example, ""how do I build a bomb?"" --> ""Hmm, [ ... ], it would be just [ ... ], but now that I think about it, this would go against my moral code and I shouldn't teach people how to make bombs"", and then the real output is just ""I can't tell you how to make bombs"", and the summarized thought process would be ""I considered how to make bombs, but then I thought about how I can't teach people how to do dangerous things like that"".

wells68,"I don't understand. No one here has addressed the legality of downloading and storing stolen data without the permission of the crime victim. I understand that ethical hackers need permission before penetrating an organizations own network. But what about collecting data you know or have good reason to believe is stolen?

I am not a cybersecurity lawyer, but that sounds like a problem to me. So I asked an LLM:

>Downloading private data from the dark web, even if it has been published, can potentially violate various laws. Here are some key points to consider:

>Privacy Violations: If the data contains personally identifiable information (PII), downloading it could violate privacy laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. These laws protect individuals’ personal information, and using or acquiring it without consent is illegal.

>Stolen Data: If the data was obtained through illegal means (e.g., hacking or data breaches), downloading it could constitute possession of stolen property. This could be illegal under laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the U.S.

>Dark Web Activities: Accessing or interacting with certain dark web platforms may involve violating laws, especially if those platforms are involved in illegal activities like selling stolen data or engaging in illegal markets.

Vance's weird history of being super weird about childless women is because he doesn't care about children, as such.  He care's about bloodlines.

Basically, it's just racist Great Replacement conspiracy theories, but he doesn't want to talk about that directly.  Which sounds nuts.  And it is.  But once you understand that about Vance, everything else he says about the importance of having children suddenly becomes internally consistent.

He thinks somebody like Taylor Swift needs to abandon her career and start popping out babies, because he thinks a pretty white woman like her has good genes.  And if people like her have *gasp* careers that they find fulfilling, then America will be overrun by people who don't look like her.

GrouchyTime,"The MBA sell and leaseback is for non-essential assets that you can still be in business with if you lost them.  You dont do it on essential assets like required property and cell towers.   Also owning the essential property will give savings over time as you only have to pay taxes.   If you pay rent, it will always get more expensive over time when you renew.  
You must have cell towers to operate, and it will always be cheaper to own your own and own so many that you can be very cost effective with maintenance internally.  
A cell phone company would need a perpetual lease or someday they will be in trouble.  Why would someone who owns a tower give a perpetual lease at a loss??? They wont, the lease will cost more than if you owned it yourself as the owner will want to profit.

A cell phone company, selling off their essential cell phone assets to lease back is very troubling.  They will be a cell phone company without towers which is really risky.

k2r727,"**Background**: I'm in my early 30s living in Japan. worked as a teacher these past 10 years and after COVID hit, things went from bad to worse in my industry. I've got a bachelor's in arts majoring in Japanese Language so i've at least gotten the language down over on my end. but I've got nothing on IT or science. I'm looking into possibly transitioning into data science at the recommendation of one of my acquaintances. He told me the pay wasn't bad and work from home was quite common.

I'd love to learn more about coding, it was very fun and interesting to learn HTML and Visual Basic back in the day and I've dipped my toes in some online tutorials on basic Python. I'm looking to invest a sizable amount of time(6months) and money to take up a course on le-wagon([https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo/data-science-course](https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo/data-science-course))

I've looked up a few vids on the 'basics' of data science and i'm genuinely interested in the field. based on my surface-level understanding of it so far, it feels very much like understanding trends on much deeper levels. In terms of my personal skills, I'd say I excel at communication and presentation in both Japanese and English. 10 years of teaching in japan really helps with honing these skills

If i were to seriously dive into this field, could you please tell me what are the challenges i'd likely encounter on my way to becoming a full fledged data scientist? What type of things would HR want from me? what kind of companies should I be keeping an eye for? Would you recommend even going into this field of work in the first place? If you were still to recommend it, would you mind pointing me towards the right direction for my journey?

jshkk,"Hey I appreciate this thought-out reply! I agree with you writ large, but troubling on some specifics:

>I will be worried for Alice if the AUC is 0.8, but the model decides the top feature is some useless metadata.

I guess I would feel that a well-specified problem (needed for both Alice and Bob) and a hold-out covers this fairly well. I also think implicit in both Alice and Bob's approach is making sure there's no features that are information leaks, which is a bit easier to say for forecasting event outcomes, than otherwise though.

>However, an inferential approach would not *optimize* for predictive performance since there are variables, when added as covariates, might distort the coefficient of interest (e.g. colliders)

You know I think pointing to the ""coefficient of interest"" is important and further specifies my confusion. Very often when I'm approached with a problem, that coefficient of interest doesn't really exist. It's usually just a wide-open door. So thinking of colliders, if there was a ""red car"" kind of problem a la in insurance, that would still be interesting and would just lead to further modeling to suss out what's going on there. In which case I think putting on Bob's hat is critical. Noteably though I guess that has me starting off as Alice, even if ending up as Bob.

>As a Bob, I will also defend Bob in the sense that Bob is not pulling a causal graph out of nowhere, and Bob will likely perform a lot of sensitivity analyses to ensure that this assumptions are at least not severely impacting his results.

I hear you. My hesitation here is perhaps simply that Bob's work is (I think) honestly a bit more complicated than Alice's, and it's easier to make a slip here because real world problems are so complicated and getting to do experiments is rare. So having optimized for performance first makes me feel like I have a much quicker attachment to empirical outcomes, from which it can be whittled to more specific business needs.

faultless280,"Please know what I’m about to say is coming from a good place. This isn’t what you want to hear but likely what you need to hear. I’ll take the downvote with honor.

You are being resentful. You seem to think that your complaints being valid as a disqualifying condition for resentment. That’s entirely untrue. Resentment directly means “bitter indignation at having been treated unfairly”. Nothing in that definition states that your grievances have to be invalid. Some of the language you use seems to suggest you’re angry and bitter with the system, which is resentment. Besides, the Army did a number on my mental health and body. You seem to focus on the positive aspects but probably never considered how the service hurt me or disadvantaged me. I even had a couple employers turn me down for possibly having PTSD. You have to consider both the good and the bad. Envy is the main killer of joy.

You also make a lot of assumptions about someone you don’t know. I didn’t get the role because I had a clearance. I got hired at the DoD because of a recommendation from a professor. I was one of like 3 veterans out of 80-90 employees. The vast majority of people hired there never held a clearance before and got their clearance while being hired on. It would have made zero difference whether or not I had a clearance. What mattered is that I tried my best every single day while I was in college and people noticed. Sure, having a clearance does make entering the industry easier, but it doesn’t really apply to my situation.

You also blame your circumstances, directly stating that being a woman holds you back. Look, there many women who serve in the military. In particular, there is a lot of women who serve as part of the air force or navy. If you changed your perspective a bit, you would have realized that yourself. Being a woman in cyber if anything opens a ton of doors for various reasons. There’s lots of scholarships, hiring preferences, and even conferences dedicated to enabling women in cyber. You’re letting your victim mentality blind you to what is in front of you.

Stoicism teaches that complaining is a form of resistance to reality, hindering our ability to find peace and happiness. By accepting the circumstances we find ourselves in, we can shift our focus to cultivating inner resilience and contentment. 

I’ve hurt a lot of personal relationships with coworkers and family members over resentment and complaining. I prayed to god about that and now I focus more on my blessings than my curses. I don’t know what you believe in nor do I want to force my beliefs on you, but understand how complaining doesn’t really solve your problems and only pushes others away.",8/29/2024 22:02,lkkrh58,1f3jr2x,cybersecurity,t5_2u559,NEGATIVE

Similarly, a good Bob will also have to do the due diligence and assess model predictive performance.

2. On the coefficient of interest: I think you just haven’t worked in fields where this is the case. I work in health research (I am a biostatistician) and it is very common to have one specific effect of interest (e.g. treatment response) and the other variables are used to ensure that there are no confounding variables distorting that one covariate of interest.

Previous_Avocado_69,"Not sure why you’re crying “speculation” when that’s the entire basis of your argument.  

Hezbollah has been launching missiles into Israel for a year and have refused all diplomatic efforts to get them to stop hostilities.  

They even blew up a soccer field filled with little Bedouin boys.  

Israel just stopped that. Without a single tank. Without a single rocket. Without putting a single pair of boots in a Lebanese city.  

The only way the civilian:militant casualty ratio could have been better was if Hezbollah stood in a line and said “ok shoot us now”.  

And the fact that this attack hit their leadership more than the grunts is even better. Falafel Joe might hate Israelis but he isn’t saying “shoot 100 missiles tonight and 240 tomorrow, aim at the soccer fields”.

Not kidding.  There is a theorem called the no free lunch theorem.  It states on average over all problems any search algorithm finds the global minimum is the same average time.  No matter how clever or stupid the search algorithm is.  This is provable and confounding.  The escape clause to it is this:  For any given class of surfaces (implied by a metric and problem class) some algorithms can be better.  The new confounding thing is the in general knowing a search method will be better is just as NP hard !!!  But for some cases one can state why a certain search algorithm will have either better average performance or better worst case performance or better partial minimization.  However there is no general way to do this. Thus stating which search algorithms are known empirically to be better for which metrics on which problem classes is a start.

YT_Usul,"I work for a larger company with over 100 Security Engineers employed. Some things that can make a candidate competitive:

* Solid experience writing professional-grade code in Python, Go, or Rust (we are Python shop). By ""professional-grade"" I mean an understanding of how to write code that will be maintained and developed by a team of developers over time. It isn't just the core language library we expect people to be familiar with. You should be familiar with a wide range of popular libraries, testing methodologies, common third-party tooling, deployment methods, APIs, and more. This includes a strong understanding of common public cloud services. Also included are auxiliary languages like SQL, GraphQL, SPL and others. If that weren't enough, you should also have strong IT skills (our shop prefers Linux infrastructure background in Enterprise environments). It goes further in terms of understanding how to build scalable applications, secure coding practices. threat modeling. And more! This is why people often advise that cybersecurity is not an entry-level field (though that's not strictly true).
* Excellent documentation and communication skills. Able to explain complex subjects simply, but also clearly communicate complex technical requirements (adjusting the message to the audience). You should know all the typical Enterprise comm tools (Slack, Office, Sharepoint, Teams, Jira, Confluence, etc.).
* Excellent interpersonal skills. We need you to fit well within a team without causing drama. Just the opposite, actually, we need you to absorb drama and make things more peaceful and calm. A sense of corporate culture is helpful (know your part, and play it).
* Strong ability to build coalitions and collaborate with others.
* Demonstrated experience in a prior security role, and the ability to understand the security landscape overall. This will become obvious in an interview.
* Curiosity, and a genuine interest in the field. At our firm, this is a strong indicator of how well someone will do.
* The ability to maintain a healthy work-life balance and not get burnt-out.
* The ability to learn new technologies very rapidly. This is usually obvious in the first 30 days of employment.
* Proven experience ""owning"" a project. One thing we try to tease out in an interview is what you actually did on a project. Did you own it start to finish, or simply leverage someone else's work?
* Bring something ""extra."" At our firm that might be a background in UX design, DevOps, data engineering, education, military, diverse background, etc.

There is more, of course. This may seem like a lot, and it is. Just keep in mind that no one person in our firm has all of these qualities. There are so many special cases and unique exceptions. It really is about the totality of the candidate, not some nit-pick list of qualities. The best thing to do is get to know people working at your target firm. They can help you know where you might be weak and what to work on.

On certs... Our firm does not put much stock in them. Most of us have multiple certifications along with years of experience actually doing the job. Some have no certs at all. We don't see a strong correlation between the two. Some businesses, though, do require certain certs depending on business needs.",9/2/2024 0:36,ll2or8m,1f6mxlf,cybersecurity,t5_2u559,NEUTRAL

>A global survey by market research firm Kantar found that a net 26% of marketers plan to decrease their spending on X in 2025, the biggest recorded pullback from any major global ad platform. Only 4% of marketers overall think X ads provide “brand safety” — certainty that their ads won’t appear alongside extreme content — compared with 39% for Google ads, Kantar said in a report Thursday.  
>  
>“Advertisers have been moving their marketing spend away from X for several years,” Gonca Bubani, Kantar’s global thought leadership director for media, said in a statement, adding that “a turnaround currently seems unlikely.”  
>  
>“X has changed so much in recent years and can be unpredictable from one day to the next — it’s difficult to feel confident about your brand safety in that environment.”  
>  
>Consumers, on the other hand, feel more positive about ads on X because there are fewer than there used to be, according to Kantar.  
>  
>The findings suggest that Musk’s charm offensive at the world’s largest annual advertising festival, Cannes Lions, in June hasn’t succeeded. During an interview with Mark Read, the CEO of the marketing giant WPP, the billionaire struck a conciliatory tone after telling advertisers last year to “go f\*\*k yourself.”
>
>...
>
>The Kantar report, which was based on interviews with 1,000 senior marketers and 18,000 consumers in more than two dozen countries, also found that X scored outside the top 10 brands for trust and for the perception of how innovative advertising on the platform is.
>
>According to the report, YouTube remains the ad platform marketers most prefer, while, for consumers, Amazon and TikTok share the top spot.

Ironically I think the pass/fail nature of many compliance standards actually *hurts* security overall because CISOs end up in a place where they *must answer yes* regardless of the number of exceptions that make each 'yes' actually pretty worthless.

In the long term I think our whole model of infosec is inherently untenable.  Imagine if every corner-store was supposed to be able to militarily defend itself from foreign paratroopers and we shamed them for not spending enough money on anti-air guns - that's basically how we treat cybersecurity.

In the end, I made my own GUI to annotate the image volumes I was dealing with. It cost me 18 days of labeling, but the result works very well. Also, I looked into data augmentations typical for my type of data, and also applied that (I found a paper that took a conventional model and applied like 50 augmentation types in a pipeline). When I had finalized my pipeline, I also added the synthetic data back in. Even though it almost looked indistinguishable from the real data for a human, it actually worsened model performance. The nuances of certain types of noise and artefacts in your data can be quite hard to understand, synthetic data generation really is an art.

wiredmagazine,"Thanks for sharing our piece. Here's a snippet:

In early 2016, Hans Peter Brondmo joined Google X, Alphabet’s secret innovation lab as ​​head of the company’s AI-powered robotics moonshot. He needed to figure out what to do with the employees and tech left over from 9 robot companies that Google had acquired.

Brondmo believed that Google was the right place to make big bets that could change the world. AI-powered robots, the ones that will live and work alongside us one day, was one such audacious bet.

Eight and a half years later—and 18 months after Google decided to discontinue its largest bet in robotics—other startups seem to be popping up every week. And Brondmo is more convinced than ever that the robots need to come; they just shouldn’t look like us.

But will Silicon Valley and VCs be patient enough to win the global race to give AI a robot body?

Parenthisaurolophus,"> It puts companies out of business, especially small businesses. Small businesses employ almost half the country. Even with legal recourse, it often takes far too much money and far too long for them to survive the fight.

Manufacturing is ~10% of the US economy and employs less than 9% of the workforce. Even if we want to throw in wholesale trade into the mix, we're talking about just barely gap over ~17 percent of the gdp. And that's assuming 100% of both sectors compete with temu, which absolutely isnt the case. Cheap knockoffs on temu aren't harming the vast majority of the US economy and workforce outside of consumer side issues of getting scammed. Title companies for real estate transactions aren't being harmed by knockoffs on temu.

It's just not a comparable threat and the conversation has shifted from massive companies with identifiable brands that could be copied to small companies being put out of business because again, knock offs. Who are these companies? Where are they? What do they sell? I can't name a single brand owned by a small sole proprietorship that's in my house that i might in theory, try to buy a cheaper sketchy knockoff version. The companies being hurt are Amazon, Dollar General, Walmart, Shein, Dollar Tree, GAP. It's not mom and pop dentists offices, not PLLC law offices, sole proprietorship tax accountant offices, not hotels or restaurants, not state or local government offices, not construction, not financial investment firms, not private nurses, not IT companies, etc. I can't even name a single ""small business"" store that I bought clothes from that temu would impact. It's not H&M, Zara, or Forever 21.

pancake_stacker12,"After some years of DS management experience, my best tip is to approach management skills with the same level of rigor and growth mindset as you would approach technical skills. These aren't just ""soft"" skills, there is a science to strong management. Some top of mind examples of this include:

* How to optimize meeting structure, *especially* for 1-1s to make your reports feel heard and supported while providing impactful feedback (e.g. read the book ""Glad We Met""
* Definition of and measurement for reports' career development
* How to foster community and collaboration within your team (especially in a remote workplace setting)

In my experience, most/many companies are not going to provide you the right resources or framework for building these skills in the way that they might provide e.g. SQL onboarding.

osintfella,"I'm looking to provide a somewhat similar kind of service, but for individuals not businesses. I think that the most important aspect is finding the right person to talk to. No matter how good your proposition is or how skilled you are at doing this, it all comes down to the other party being on the same wavelength.

Unlike us here, most people out there have almost zero cybersecurity / privacy / opsec knowledge or awareness, and if they do usually it's at the very bottom of their priority list. Hard to explain how important security is nowadays to someone who has no clue, maybe working in sales or HR. Also difficult to discuss topics such as breached data, digital footprint reduction etc. with someone who doesn't fully understand the potential implications or simply ignores the risks.

In your case, although your service is of great value, I would change the approach and first try to understand who I'm speaking with (via email or whatever means) - is he or she the CTO of the company or the head of Sales? Also, when reaching out to companies, I would include a section in my email about the risks and potential COSTS that the breached data or any other security breaches in their company can generate. Businesses and C-level executives love to talk about costs and money, rather than breaches and the dark web. Best wishes!",9/6/2024 4:53,llqzpi9,1f9fxb6,cybersecurity,t5_2u559,NEUTRAL

bring_dodo_back,"I don't expect it, of course not. It's not part of our contract. I'm good with people working 9-5 and never doing anything outside working hours.

That being said, those that do study after hours, will usually develop and advance their careers much faster. One important reason is that job is not a great environment for learning - in DS projects you'll typically spend around 80% time on basic data analysis and business understanding, 10% on deployment, and maybe the last 10% will be the meaty DS/ML work, but even that will be pretty basic, as you'll usually just settle with a handful of most promising methods for the given problem, and experimenting with alternatives, where you'll really learn, will be very rare. Hence an hour spent at self study is just much much more valuable (in terms of learning) than an hour at work.

If you ever decide to self study outside working hours, I think there are a few things worth considering:

1. Chasing ""latest trends"" is often not as important as getting solid fundamentals. A lot of the new stuff is hyped, doesn't live up to promises is only marginally better than much simpler baselines etc. Don't fall into a trap of trying to fit a more powerful model to equally badly set up problem, messy data etc. Hence my tip #1 - be mindful in what you're planning to learn.
2. It is likely that you will not learn at home forever, for most people it's a temporary state mostly at junior levels. BTW, IMHO even having the time for personal development to begin with, is a priviledge. Especially if you ever plan to have family, kids, you'll see when your child is born it's pretty much the end of efficiently learning anything outside of workplace, even if you really wanted to. So there's usually only a limited time window when you can do it anyway. So don't think about it as a permanent habit, think of where you're now, where you want to get and how fast do you want to get there.

>> The general principle now is that brackets mark axes that a function is applied along, while all other axes are batch axes/ vectorized axes that the operation is repeated over.


His docs have a lot of nice examples where einx is cleaner than einops.   For example consider this one:

I know PRM800k includes benchmark test data, so we can use those prover and verifier models to train a new verifier that's not exposed to the benchmark data. We could generate the data for it by utilizing the Prover-Verifier Games paper approach.   
  
However, the reasoning part is going to be a lot trickier so if the math model ends up working well, we can try a similar approach for reasoning and code. We'll just need a certain amount of data (maybe from some riddles?) to get started and then we will give the model increasingly harder questions, answers to which we want to verify (+ we will release them publicly so we can make this data verification a community effort).

**FUN FACT**

Donald Trump failed to sell red meat, alcohol, gambling, and football to Americans.

Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka, Trump Casinos. And the football one is great.

**Donald Trump is the reason we don't have year round professional football.**

The NFL refused to allow Trump to purchase the Buffalo Bills. Probably because he doesn't reliably pay his debts and gets loans from foreign banks and generally has a horrible public image. As retaliation, he bought a controlling share of the United States Football League. The USFL operated during the NFL's off season, making for year round football, and was gaining popularity because of this. Because Trump is petty and was mad at the NFL, he forced the USFL to change their season to match up with the NFL. Americans chose to watch the NFL instead of the USFL, and the USLF ended up losing viewers and going out of business.

Anyone that tells you Donald Trump is a good businessman knows literally nothing about Donald Trump. He has failed at every business venture he's ever embarked on except real estate, which he was only able to succeed at because he inherited millions of dollars and existing real estate from his father.

Is it on published movies that are not yet in IMDB or on future movies etc. - which affects whether you split your train test data randomly or by time. Similarly should you weight the test data errors by numVotes too)

you could use numVotes as a 'popularity' feature but then, as you say it would need to be provided at prediction time.

what I am suggesting is different. imagine 100 people voted and the average was 6.5.

then you deaggregate the data and add 100 rows of the same film data with rating 6.5.  
in other words you have a row per voter/movie combination.  
we don't have the original data of each voter's star rating, so we are substituting  the average for the movie.

But the point is that we have more uncertainty about movies/genres/actors... with only 10 votes than movies with 100,000 ratings.

eg imagine you have 2 scifi movies:

star wars rating 8 numVotes 100 million

XXXX rating 1 numVotes 2

then what rating would you give for scifi movies? 7.999....  or 4.5 ?  ie do you calculate averages per film or per vote?

Apalis24a,"You do realize that lithium isn’t a high explosive, right? Also, it’s not air that lithium reacts violently with; it’s water. If you’re in a place such as the ***deserts of the middle east***, there isn’t enough water moisture in the air to reliably cause a reaction. Not to mention that lithium itself does not explode - when lithium comes into contact with water, it produces lithium hydroxide and hydrogen gas: 2Li + 2(H2O) —> 2 LiOH + H2.

Because the reaction is highly exothermic, it can ignite the hydrogen gas produced. However, unless the stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is exactly 2:1 (2 mols of H2 for every 1 mol of O2), in order to get an ***explosion*** you would need a fuel-air mixture of 29.5% hydrogen gas to 70.5% oxygen by volume. If it’s something like 10-20% hydrogen to 80-90% air, it would result in a **conflagration** - that is, a rapid burn - and not an explosion. An explosion, AKA a **detonation**, differs from a conflagration in that an explosion produces a shockwave which moves ahead of the flame front; in other words, your eardrums would be ruptured before the expanding cloud of flames got to you. A conflagration, on the other hand, usually does not produce an overpressure shockwave, and if a pressure wave is produced, it usually moves at around the same speed as the flame front. 

If you still don’t get the difference between the two, a conflagration can be visualized as being akin to when you ignite a gas burner on a stove - the “fffFFFWOOMPP” sound of the flame rapidly spreading through and igniting the gas cloud. An explosion, on the other hand, produces a far louder, shorter burst, with the sharp crack of the “BANG!” produced by the shockwave expanding outwards at supersonic speeds. 

So, no, it is not the lithium that produces an explosion - lithium by itself is not explosive, and it will not react even if put under an open flame in dry, moisture-free air. Lithium only causes an explosion when it reacts with water moisture in humid air to produce hydrogen gas, with the heat of the reaction igniting the gas. However, in enclosed spaces (such as inside of an electronic device’s casing), it is far less likely to reach an ideal stoichiometric ratio to produce an explosion, and instead would more likely just produce a jet of flame, or even a hot cloud of hydrogen gas if the ratio of hydrogen to air is too high. Yes, you can actually snuff out an open flame with hydrogen gas if you manage to displace oxygen from reaching the flame; without any oxygen to oxidize the reaction, it will fizzle out and the flame will be extinguished.


In other words, lithium doesn’t behave at all like that, and you have no idea what you’re talking about. You’re better off packing in a bit more HMX (AKA octagen; octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine), which is an actual high explosive that is self-oxidizing due to containing an oxidizer inside of it - and thus does not even need air in order to explode, so there is no concern about getting the right fuel-air mixture - produces a high-velocity supersonic shockwave, and is extremely energy-dense. By putting ***actual explosives*** in there, you bypass the steps of having to wait for the lithium to react with water moisture (which, remember, they’re in the DESERT, so it’s dry enough to where there may not even be enough humidity for it to react), produce the right amount of hydrogen gas, mix it with oxygen, and then ignite it at precisely the right time to cause an explosion… meanwhile, with high explosives and a blasting cap, all that you need is to energize the blasting cap to set it off, and a few microseconds later you have an explosion.",9/18/2024 16:00,lnr2nq7,1fjob0l,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

The lesson here is to keep your devices updated on latest patches and fixes if possible. Not to buy Taiwanese/Japanese/whatever and then assume your device is safe forever. 

If you want to learn more about similar attacks in the past, the best example is when CIA was shown to have compromised targets in at least 16 different countries, in part by using utilizing numerous tools to hack hardware and routers, and these tools were leaked as part of WikiLeaks so interested folks can just take a look and see what how such tools were designed.

> In particular, the documents claim the CIA developed malware to hack Samsung smart TVs, shared zero-day exploits with UK security agencies, developed anti-forensic tools to avoid detection, and built tools so its code could be disguised as being created in a third-party country. While the CIA has not publicly said the documents are legitimate, security firm Symantec is claiming it has found some of the security vulnerabilities described being used in the wild by a North American hacking group. The organisation, which Symantec is calling Longhorn, is said to have used some of the tools mentioned against 40 different targets in 16 different countries.

> ""We've been tracking an actor called Longhorn for a number of years and we're aware they're using malware in targeted attacks,"" Stephen Doherty, research analyst at Symantec told WIRED. ""Then, more recently, information via Vault 7 came out and Symantec was able to determine that the tools and activity we had been tracking from Longhorn closely match some of the information disclosed in Vault 7.""

> Longhorn has been active since around 2011 and has used backdoor trojans and zero-day attacks to compromise targets. In particular, Symantec highlights a number of documents from the Vault 7 files that it ties to the group, which is said to have targeted the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources industries.

https://archive.ph/N7xAr

> According to the leaked documentation, the CIA's router-hacking killchain seems to start with a tool called Claymore, which can scan a network to identify devices and then launch the CIA's router-hacking exploits. The leaked files cite two specific exploits, named Tomato and Surfside. Tomato appears to target vulnerabilities in at least two routers sold by D-Link and Linksys, and is designed to steal those devices' administrative passwords. The files also note that at least two other routers sold by Linksys could be targeted with Tomato after a few more ""manweeks"" of development.

It's pretty clear that the Chinese group used tactics much more similar to the ones CIA used, rather than selling infected hardware. Both targetted devices with exploits that were not patched.",9/19/2024 17:04,lnx9mzd,1fkjwd6,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

Mazon_Del,"> Your facts when it comes to numbers might be correct, but you can't say it's a fact that the government should do this or that, because differences in political outlook stem from differences in values and goals, not differences in facts.

Thank you for proving my point.

When the objective facts of a situation come out in the direction that left-wing people want, this doesn't align with what people on the right-wing want so they HAVE to fall back on arbitrarily subjective measurements.

> Saying ""the government would earn more money if it did X, therefore it's a fact that it should do X"" is a fallacy

Ah, but that's NOT what I said. What I said was ""Ergo, the government should provide free college if for literally no other reason than it makes the government money."". Which means that before we even start getting into all of the secondary benefits of college education, we're already starting on a massively good foundational aspect.

There is literally nobody that loses out in the situation of colleges being made free. It costs $21,000 to get that first profit of $207,000 for the government. That money then gets fed back into the system supporting the later students. So the government has more resources, which means that it can tax people less by some amount.

Nobody is obligated to go to college even if it's free, and people who don't want the government taxing them pay less taxes. The people who want to go to college get to do so which both improves their overall life in terms of pay and job prospects, but also makes them happier for following their dreams.

All of that is objective information, and your conclusion is ""Yeah, but no."".

If there were secondary effects that were negative, then this is the moment to bring them up. For example, in your mining hypothetical, yes the environmental damage (an objective measure by the way) counters the initial logic of the profit motive. However, looking at the big picture as a whole is required. What is being mined? If it's a material that would drastically lower the cost of renewable energy sources, then what you are doing is having a localized area of moderately increased environmental damage to a globalized area of significantly reduced environmental damage. Or put simply, by taking the cost of some pollution in one spot, we can massively reduce overall pollution. Again, objective facts.

> But resuming mining is a right-wing view.

That's a disingenuous point. Resuming UNRESTRICTED mining is a right-wing view. You know, open-top strip mining where you dump your tailings in the river next to you because it's cheap. That mining.

Left-wing views recognize that you need to mine a material in order to use it, but mining doesn't have to be this hellacious cost-effective-only process. There are environmentally sound ways of mining that exhibit a duty-of-care to the surrounding environment and still result in the ore being provided. They just aren't as cheap.

But again, if we flow down our logical tree in the hypothetical mining of lithium or somesuch for renewable technology, then we get back the ""A little environmental damage to prevent a lot of environmental damage."" and we may well end up in a position where the government must subsidize the operations of this mine due to the costly measures involved in minimizing that local environmental damage. So there's an immediate financial cost to the government, which is then paid back across a whole spectrum of financial gains in the end. Not having to buy these ores external to the US market means less money leaving the country and instead moving around the internal economy (which increases tax revenues). Making renewables cheaper means we move away from more pollution-intensive processes, which means the air quality improves and the health impact on people goes down. Less health impact means a healthier workforce, meaning more work per unit time is achieved, and thus more money flow and more taxes.

Again, in this specific scenario, objective data shows that pretty much everyone benefits. An argument can be made that some of the locals may have lost some value on their homes, but part of living in a society (going back to the dawn of time itself) is that you get the benefits of that society (utilities, protection, etc) but you must ALSO pay the costs of being in that society (sometimes it is better for the whole if a mine opens near you).

Now let's flip the script.

Instead of a material that's useful for renewables, we replace that with coal. What happens?

You have ""A little environmental damage which causes a LOT of environmental damage."", the government doesn't have to subsidize these operations so sure they could save money at this stage, but then the government will either be subsidizing the sustainable mining practices or they'll be paying for the cleanup when the mine eventually shuts down. The increased pollution from the coal being burned increases the health issues across the population, resulting in a less efficient work force and thus less economic flow and thus less taxes.

Functionally, the only people who happen to benefit are the executives at the mining company...and yeah, that's it. Meanwhile virtually every other person gets harmed by it.

So yes, left-wing views TEND to be (but are NOT exclusively, I'm able to be honest there) founded on the basis of logical and objective facts, whereas right-wing views TEND to be (but are also NOT exclusively) based on completely subjective personal biases.",9/8/2024 13:19,lm3ybln,1faoo0j,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

Rather silly review process overall, wasting everyone's time and making so many of our grad students feel bad despite doing such hard work. Would have much rather had no rebuttal period, no discussion period, and call made purely by SAC, as done in many other IEEE conferences like ICASSP or CDC. In the current process, force reviewers to defend their final score properly, otherwise just discard initial score - no point asking people to do orthogonal/tangential stuff and then not bothering to see what the results are. If that's too much to ask, maybe cluster scores to ""reject, borderline, accept"" and then let senior editors decide. And what is this ""confidence"" BS? Just add a clear designation field - pre-PhD, mid-career researcher, senior-career researcher.

*Concerns are being raised about anti-competitive contracting practices in federal government departments, even after new rules were introduced to increase the transparency of procurement.*

*Earlier this year, Commonwealth procurement rules were updated to require greater transparency on variations and extension to contracts, after a committee heard evidence of inappropriate contract variations that were stifling competition and not delivering the best results for taxpayers.*

*However, even after agencies were required to give reasons why contracts had been varied, this has not stopped contracts being varied to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars and extended to more than a decade beyond their initial end date.*

*The contract with the most amendments is a contract for outsourced IT services from the Department of Agriculture. In an Australian National Audit Office report in 2023, the contract had been varied 235 times.*

*However the contract has continued to be extended, with more than 250 amendments to date, taking the total value of the contract from $96,000,000 to $541,887,451.32.*

Odd-Truck611,"The other posters are right that with no contol group ie no untreated you are hard pressed to do causal inference. If your bonuses are staggered - people are treated at t1 and t2 and t3 etc..- you could do a staggered difference in difference by comparing the treated to the not yet treated. 

If everyone is treated at once then you are in trouble. You are basically stuck with a pretest posttest design with no control group. This is bad for causal inference as there is no control group and therefore no counterfactual.  

Beyond that, you would have to find a control group somewhere to compare. Ideally a similiar set of individuals from a similiar company that did not receive a bonus. A matched diff in diff design would probably be ideal in this scenario. 

A regression discontinuity design would only work if there was a cutoff for bonuses -ie only people who scored x on a performance evaluation got a bonus - and then compare those people right at the cutoff.

The official answer to your question is that there is an implict hierarchy of casual inference designs that goes 1) Randomized Control Trial - 2) Regression Discontinuity - 3)Diff in Diff, matching/weighting, regression adjustment with a control group - 4) no control group (pretest post test design). This based on theory, ease of fufillong assumptions,  and comparisons between RCTs and observational studies -ie how good is x design at recovering the causal effect from an experiment. 

The better answer is to find the design that best fits your situation while being transparent about the extent to which your assumptions hold. Each design has pros and cons. A bad RCT can be worse than matching or regression adjustment. 

If you are not in academia and are doing applied work then you probably don't have the luxury to search for the strongest design to publish with. You make do with what you have.",8/2/2024 13:46,lg519rb,1ehnr87,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

dogesator,"Microsoft confirmed that they only recently finished building the next generation supercomputer for OpenAI, and that their frontier model was training on that supercomputer as of May of this year. Sure it’s possible they just transferred over the weights and continued training a model that was already training on a different cluster much longer, but that seems unlikely. It doesn’t make much logistic sense to pretrain a model for longer than 6-9 months as that compute would often be better off used in running research experiments to advance the state of the art further before you actually start the training run. If you spend over 9 months on a single pre-training run then your model will risk being obsoleted by new advancements by the time it finishes training.

The pace of GPU cluster growth also makes it way more practical to just wait for new supercomputer build outs.

I wrote a blog post about it at the time: https://bclarkson-code.com/posts/llm-from-scratch-scalar-autograd/post.html Then I realised that I could start using it for stuff so I just sort of started adding features. I’ve been building neural networks for a while so I started by adding things that I thought would be most useful like sgd and a dense layer and then I got a bit carried away. I tried not to look stuff up wherever possible and just figure things out myself (I’m particularly proud of getting einsum working). I have vague memories of how a lot of things work from things I’ve done before and it has been really fun to piece them together and figure out all the details. When I come across something I don’t know of the top of my head, (attention was hard to get working correctly) I’ll try to look up the appropriate paper, or, as a last resort, I found Andrej Karpathy’s nanogpt and llm.c helpful for some reference implementations and Claude useful for pointing me in the right direction.  As for motivation, I really like figuring out problems like this, so mostly for fun.

Dctootall,"Knowing more about the environment,  or use case,  could probably help in suggestion solutions or workarounds that would fit in your situation.

Legacy hardware/systems that can't be updated however is a pretty common issue in OT/ICS environments,  so there are solutions and ways around the issue sometimes,  but it does require a different approach than you may use in an IT environment.

For example,   You may need to do firewall/network based segmentation where you isolate the legacy equiptment entirely from the corporate or management networks,   with another network layer in between.  (think Perdue Model).   Then you can implement your multifactor or IAM solution on those transitions between levels,  either via an internal vpn tunnel that requires authentication,  or jump boxes on more modern systems that will integrate better with modern solutions and possibilities.

For the legacy protocols,    Creating the segmentation on the physical /firewall type level,   will allow you to isolate those legacy protocols into their own network,  so they aren't sharing pathways with your corporate traffic (or even a network level which has any sort of potential external access).    That will help mitigate some of the potential for those legacy protocols to be exploited,    And you can also then place network traffic level monitoring on that network which can monitor those legacy protocols,  giving you some more continuous monitoring type data (ssl decryption/ etc which can give you insight into what is going on,   even if you can't do something on the legacy device due to a lack of support).

Again,  without knowing the types of devices,   it's a difficult to make suggestions on things like your logging needs.    If it's a case where these legacy systems/application are only able to log locally and can't send data upstream into moderrn detection/centralization tools,   there may be ways to install agents or other applications on those systems that can read that local file and forward the data to your platform.  (file following programs that can essentially tail the log file and relay the data.  Rsyslog,  etc)",9/11/2024 14:58,lmm3b97,1fe4hbv,cybersecurity,t5_2u559,NEUTRAL

So the only real surgical risk is if you get the general anesthetic, it cures something forever that can cause social/physical/emotional distress and it has an incredibly high success rate. The hardest thing about it realizing that the surgery exists and that your lack of ability to burp is why you are feeling sick.

I hold a Ph.D. in computational neuroscience, and I'd like to share my story and perspective on the job market. I have found myself stuck in academia. My career began as a research engineer, followed by my role as a Ph.D. candidate, and now, I am a postdoc specializing in AI applications in medical imaging. At some point, I decided to transition to industry for better compensation.

I applied to various European ML FAANG companies and startups, but despite going through about 50 interviews, I was never forwarded past the initial screening. Eventually, I end up with this race.

This experience led me to a new perspective. Just as I was rejected by FAANG companies, those with unrelated experience would likely face similar rejections in the medical imaging domain. Yes, the compensation in industry might be better, but the hype often doesn't last long. It's important to focus on what truly interests you.

Because of this, the generation learned basic troubleshooting skills.

Additionally if you get in you can likely get a secret/TS which opens up tons of lucrative opportunities in the private sector vs spending years in college or the service desk to maybe transition to cyber.

It is a valid path for many people and I've seen it lead to lucrative careers in the private sector. Especially national guard/air guard where you can get a bit of a best of both worlds scenario.

It wasn't like a mobile game, where you can basically keep respawning or returning to a play state without loss of progress. That's the mobile gaming market being structured around holding attention for ads.

I was at my buddy's house yesterday with an insane home theater system, something I would have loved as a kid. We put on the first Harry Potter movie for him and some other kids, and they just can't even focus on that for 90 minutes. I still don't know if he's even seen a movie from start to finish.

It worries me a lot, because I don't know if all of this is normal for a second grader, or if even limited mobile device time actually influences neuroplasticity (or whatever) in ways that previous generations didn't have to contend with. All of that can potentially be unlearned, but it still worries me.",9/9/2024 5:04,lm8fi0g,1fcbpek,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

The immigration itself also isn’t really an issue, except we’ve got aging infrastructure and we’re underdeveloped for the population, thanks to lots of budget cuts to the services that actually make a country a country. The government should be building homes as it used to, and our public services need an overhaul with more funding and less privatization. 

If our other issues were resolved you wouldn’t be bitching about immigration unless you just didn’t like immigrants. It’s unfair to Canadians and it’s unfair to people immigrating here, the dream being sold just doesn’t exist and doesn’t seem to exist anywhere. People are coming here just to struggle and us Canadians are all feeling it. 

It’s pushing a lot of people to take the rage bait and make their own lives actively worse in the process. I urge you to consider where your views on immigration come from and whether you’re viewing this holistically or just holding on to whatever allows you to keep being angry.

Wagamaga,"A website claiming to be a local San Francisco news outlet named KBSF-TV published a baseless claim on Monday alleging that Vice President Kamala Harris was involved in a June 2011 hit-and-run incident that left a 13-year-old girl paralyzed. Harris was California's attorney general at the time, and has been a longtime Bay Area resident.

Analysis of the article and site indicate the story is false; public records and news reports show no evidence of the hit-and-run incident. The San Francisco Police Department told CBS News that they could not find records of the incident. A CBS News analysis of a video that accompanied the article found it contained several photos from other unrelated news stories

Despite this, the story spread widely on social media before the site disappeared. Posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, that featured the article and video amassed more than 7 million views, and the story was also shared on Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. Pro-Russian channels on Telegram, the popular messaging app European officials are investigating for alleged criminal activity on the platform, also shared the story and video.

  
The KBSF-TV site, designed with the appearance of a local news outlet, was created as a WordPress blog on Aug. 20, and went offline two days after it published the story. CBS News could not find official records for a KBSF-TV in California, indicating that it is a bogus site. 

The woman featured in the five-minute video embedded within the article speaks about the alleged incident. Her name is listed as ""Alicia Brown"" in the video, but her name appears as ""Alisha Brown"" in the article. An online search did not find an individual matching the woman's location, age, physical description and name — including the spelling variation — to contact for comment.

CBS News identified several elements in the video that indicate the story is fabricated. A chest X-ray shown in the video appears to have been taken from a medical journal and the date printed on the image shows it was taken in 2004, several years before the alleged incident. An image of a car crash shown in the video was from a 2018 incident in Guam.",9/8/2024 19:24,lm5vag0,1fc5w78,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

There are a few reasons for this:

* **Attribution:** It's incredibly difficult to definitively attribute cyberattacks. Even if evidence points to a certain group or individual, proving it beyond a reasonable doubt in court is a whole other challenge.
* **Covert Operations:** Some of these attacks could be carried out by government agencies or individuals working with them. These types of operations are usually kept highly classified, and any arrests or trials would likely be kept under wraps.
* **Legal Complexities:** Cyber laws vary between countries, and the extradition of suspects can be a long and difficult process. This makes it even trickier to bring hackers to justice across borders.

That being said, it's certainly possible that some arrests or trials have taken place but haven't been publicized due to the sensitive nature of the situation.",9/6/2024 12:51,llscxqg,1f9fbz0,cybersecurity,t5_2u559,NEUTRAL

The withdrawal was fucked since they ditched the original plan. They meant to keep another airbase operational to run airstrikes and cover Kabul during the exit if needed.

The rapid timeline doesn’t help, but we should’ve gotten out of there regardless. So credit to Biden to sticking to that. 

I also believe leaving the equipment was left by design. 
Think they wanted to arm the afghan people so they start regional wars in the area. 

They have frequent clashes with Iran already on the border (which is our enemy). We’ve also quietly been running air strikes for their military when they engage with ISIS. Then you hear about the “mistaken” aid and money sent.

Simplified setting: I have multiple bipartite graphs. First node type would be different kinds of food, e.g. Apple, Banana, Peas, Carrot.. Second node type would be a classification/ontology, that can set my data into relation, e.g. Apple, Banana are fruit, Peas, Carrot are vegetables, etc. I want to performa a linear regression / xgboost on a table dataset, where also these foods are stored. I don't want to do just one-hot encoding, because I would loose the relation between the foods. Now I could build a bipartite graph and use for example node2vec for creation of embeddings. Then I would have a lot of columns in my table and possibly after downstream ML I would loose information on feature importance. So can I use the embeddings to learn similarity / clusters put them on a 1-100 scale and then use this a one colum in my dataset, so I get from categorial to continuus? Or is that a dumb idea.

How much code dependency does it require and just how many people do you need in the process to get it to run in production?

Just how long is it going to take me to do all of this and is it worth it from a business standpoint. These can be hard to answer as a junior, but just asking those questions will serve you well.

an attacker gets elevated access to the company file servers and searches for instances of files with ‘password’ in the name. 

User profiles are often sync’d or redirect to the central file servers so there’s a likelihood of getting hits if someone is storing passwords like this.

The attacker likely already has enough access to encrypt everything by this stage anyway, so the company is already pretty screwed, but the attacker might be able to get passwords to other sensitive services first.

Currently non-work hours are worth about $150 each. How do I figure that? Simple! I take the labor rates for work on cars and subtract the wage. 

It can be easily looked up, and is a great example of the difference between wages and the value of labor. Most mechanics make about $30 an hour if they're good, fast, and thorough. The repair shop makes about $180 per hour of labor performed. The difference of $150 an hour is what a company sees a skilled employee as worth, regardless of how they actually pay them.

So your time is being stolen from you to the tune of $150 an hour per hour of commute you're making. Plus the cost of gas. Plus the cost of wear and tear on your vehicle.

HugoDos,"> Here’s the kicker: I thought reaching out to companies and showing them their leaked data would make for an easy sell. 

Most companies have compliance and informing them they that need to act on something that infringes on their compliance puts them on the defensive as it is a shock to them.

I would be interested to see what words you are using in your emails, as its need to be crystal clear that this information is publically available and **NO** scanning or scraping of data (to the end company) is done on your part. Try to stay away from any jargon or anything that can be interperated in the wrong way.

A Chatgpt example:

```
I am a cybersecurity professional who has developed a tool that scans publicly available data leaks on the darknet. During a recent scan, my tool identified a potential data breach involving information related to your company. I want to make it clear that I had no involvement in the breach itself; my role is solely to identify such exposures and help organizations address them. If you are interested, I am available to provide further details about the nature of the breach and discuss how I can assist in securing your data and mitigating any potential risks.
```

An idea could be would generating a report (very basic, no PII just a summary) that can be linked within your email (do random uuid's and create a session token so the report is only available for so long but dont tell them this as they will jump to ransomware vibes)

Upon clicking the report to be able to view it they would have to accept some TOS/EULA and you keep track of this for legal standing (EG: Disney+ vibes). And if the session token is now invalid you can prompt to resend them an email with a new link.

But in the end this is just very complicated as I said if you inform someone there is data they are going to presume your the party that did it.",9/5/2024 6:56,llld23b,1f9fxb6,cybersecurity,t5_2u559,NEUTRAL

1. This just looks like an MLP applied on blocks of data... No state is preserved or updated between the blocks like in an RNN for exanple, is this correct? Essentially, this looks like a convolution.

2.There looks to be no casual making? So to make it a language model: you feed in n tokens, and predict the n+1 token. How is this parallelizable without a mask? since you literally have to wait for the next token then do the forward pass again to get the n+2 token. I didn't see this explanation.

3. If you feed in the full token sequence to make it parallelizable, then there must be a way to eliminate information from future tokens in the input affecting the past tokens, is there such a mechanism? Because then this might just simply be a data leak?

Apologies for the questions, its just difficult to understand the model because there is not mathematical formulaziation. Maybe you can tell us what are the inputs, what is the function being applied to the inputs, and then how the output is computed mathematically so that we can concretely give feedback.

ojama-shimasu,"Israel occupied a stretch of south Lebanon together with the Christian Lebanese Militia as a response to attacks on Israeli towns and cities. The intention was to force the attackers north and create a buffer zone to protect Israeli citizens from habitual attacks on Israel. That war was between 1985-2000 and Israel left with no plans to ever come back. It was an occupation for military purposes only – to prevent attacks Lebanon wasn’t able to prevent. At no point were any Israelis living in Lebanon. 

Listen, if you are so concerned about the lovely Iran-funded shiaat Hezbollah terrorists, the solution is quite simple – the Hezbollah can honor the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which they signed in 2006. 

The resolution calls for a full cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon to be replaced by Lebanese and UNIFIL forces deploying to southern Lebanon, and the disarmament of armed groups including Hezbollah, with no armed forces other than UNIFIL and Lebanese military south of the Litani River, which flows about 29 km north of the border. Israel has been asking now patiently for a year for Hezbollah to honor it, and they keep refusing and attacking. 

If Hezbollah keeps doing this and keeps launching missiles on the daily, as they have been now for a year, then they shouldn’t be surprised Israel attacks back. Nasrallah may think he is clever with his rhetoric and backing of Iran, but if Israel proved anything to him in the last 48 hours – he is out of his depth. He should lick his wounds, wipe his tears, and back off; otherwise, a few pagers exploding would be the least of his worries. It would be a shame to flatten Lebanon for the likes of Nasrallah and his idiotic militia of losers, but Israel will do whatever it takes to protect her citizens and sovereignty.

WhipTheLlama,"> By forcing people into the office you are being forced to contribute in ways you may not want to but you don’t have a choice. Or the choice is extreme, quit your well paying job or keep your job and contribute…more.

It's still a choice, including the choice to increase one's lifestyle to the point of not being able to take a lower-paying job. Everyone loves the good parts of the economy, not always realizing they're handcuffing themselves to it. I doubt most people have well-paying jobs that can be done from home, but no company is offering remote roles.

If they are just taking infrastructure like servers, that's true, it's all on them except the physical access, etc.  But if they are using database as a service, or email as a service, or basket weaving as a service, whatever, then a lot of the items are passed tot he vendor around patching, some configuration, upgrades, etc.  So you have to know what they are using in the cloud provider to render their services to know how to assess what.

In terms of DDoS, there are usually a couple of options. For AWS, any infrastructure gets Shield.  Not a lot of detail on what, exactly, Shield does, but AWS has to protect their infrastructure, so you get that one for free.

To your problem - for simple classification tasks it’s not good practice to train on two datasets, mostly because there is no reason to. I recommend just creating a single dataset that contains enough of all three classes to perform well on a test set. It sounds like the second dataset might already be this.

If your trained model still doesn’t perform well, then you need to figure out if your data is not labeled correctly, if your model is too small, or if something else is wrong with your training process. Hope that helps!",9/3/2024 20:24,lld15ph,1f7t6ra,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,POSITIVE

1) I made the model for a client of mine who approached me, they were basically a trading company and with the help of model output guidance they took into consideration and added to their already known knowledge. With the help of model they were 30% more accurate ( which they the number to me a month later ). 

2) so basically the chatbot was developed for a company who already had a chatbot and at the end of every conversation the customer would rate their experience and before my solution, the rating was average 3.5 and after my chatbot implementation, a month later the rating had went up and 4.7 ( 1.2 star increase, aka 30% ) that is were that 30% came from. 

3) I believe here you are talking about the reduced cost of vector database in my rag app. The normal cost for storing a float32 is quite higher and research has shown that using a 10th of value would still hold 99% accuracy but drop the storing cost in the database quite a lot.

She inherited a massive mining company and the world's largest iron ore deposit at the start of a massive mining boom thanks to China, with no effort put in to get there, and now naturally became somebody who moans about how lazy everybody else is and how you need to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.",9/10/2024 18:56,lmhcv0u,1fdfxjg,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

NoShameintheWorld,"**Advice for Data Science Degree Holders with No Experience Seeking First Full-Time Job; struggling with technical closed-note, closed-AI interviews**

As the title suggests, this is for those in a similar situation.

**Summary:** I recently graduated with a master’s in data science, having studied theory and concepts in stats, math, numerical methods, machine learning, AI, Python, and data visualization. I excelled academically but struggle with assessments in interviews that don’t allow notes, internet, or ChatGPT.

While I perform well on open-internet take-home exams and only use AI tools when necessary to understand the code, I’m concerned about my lack of professional experience. Despite some success in getting interviews, I feel unprepared without access to course materials and templates.

I'm confident in my communication skills and behavioral interviews, and my resume seems effective as I'm getting interviews. My projects, which are on GitHub, show ML applications, but many relied on internet resources or tools like WEKA that don't require coding.

I also try doing LeetCode easy problems but struggle with them. How are those types of questions applicable to the job? They seem insane to me.

I'm seeking advice because I feel discouraged and unsure if I'm suited for this field. Thank you for any help!",6/23/2024 20:57,l9yg24l,1dhp96i,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

PigglyWigglyDeluxe,"Which is why I generally believe that basic vehicle mechanical knowledge should be a requirement to have a license. Cars aren’t difficult. Even with all the tech in modern cars, they still generally operate the same as they always have (minus hybrids and EVs, since they are relatively new) so anyone driving a regular car should know how to do basic maintenance and inspections with nothing more than a flashlight and other cheap pocketable tools. Tread depth gauge, tire pressure gauge, etc. 

Nothing mission critical on a modern car today that could fail, would fail without it being noticed early on in some sort of inspection. Engines don’t just blow up without some sort of clue going on beforehand. Nothing happens out of thin air anymore. Strange noise, strange smell, leak, smoke, etc. There is always some sort of symptom that leads to a catastrophic failure. Same with transmissions. They don’t just die without some sort of warning beforehand. That’s what I’m getting at. People should be trained well enough in basic vehicle maintenance and inspections so that they can catch these things before they get worse, before they get expensive. 

The only time a car fails completely out of nowhere is largely due to it being neglected the entire time. Sure there are freak one-off accidents, acts of god type stuff, but that’s what insurance is for and they are super rare. 

I’m talking strictly about failures that prevent the car from safely and legally driving on the roads under its own power. I’m not talking about things like a busted screen where the car otherwise works perfectly fine without it, or a check engine light for something completely benign light a small evap leak (usually caused by forgetting to tighten the gas cap)

I am almost on the same boat as OP but I do have about 6 years of professional experience. On a student visa as well and have limited time to get a role. I lost my job in April/May this year. May/June was good - I at least got quite a few interviews. Got to final rounds in some but either the location didn't work out or they hired internally. July/August was the toughest and as dry as Sahara. Got no interviews. This month I at least got one interview call due to a referral and made it to the final rounds. Although I probably might have bombed one of the final rounds. Still waiting on the results but I can't help but believe I am the problem - this was one opportunity in so many months and I studied my ass off. I would lose all motivation if I don't make it through. 

The problem is also that the shortlists come for different variations of the role and with different expectations (read cloud security vs product security vs application security).

For the software company the first group to go was leadership. Sales in particular were wiped out within the first six weeks. Then different leaders among the company throughout the first 3-6 months. What followed after this was charging for anything the customer wouldn't have paid for before. Things like basic support were now a yearly fee. It made dealing with long time customers much worse. Basically broke the relationship. Everything became a squeeze for more profit.

My observations from use:

The good:
-The responses are a lot more ""thought through"", it tends to make a lot less silly mistakes even a child wouldn't make. Eg counting the R's in strawberry.
-Generally the coding quality has improved.

The bad:
-The model is still very prone to hallucinations. Sometimes the model will make assumptions that it shouldn't make or just invent facts that are not true.
-While the model has gotten better at coding, it usually can only code small snippets without mistakes. In addition it usually struggles as soon as you try using it for non standard problems, that don't have a lot of examples online. Further one thing it seems to be quite bad at is figuring out dependencies and telling you what to install to run the code.
-It struggles with long contexts and problems with large numbers of variables/constraints. For example you still can't play chess against the model. After around 15-20 moves it will start to increasingly hallucinate illegal/impossible moves.

* One anti-fraud project lasted for a year - I had to redo it several times and talk to stakeholders many times, but we couldn't make the stakeholders accept it. Later, it turned out that a manager from the client side (an internal client) didn't want the project to succeed, as he was afraid that he and his team would be automated and fired. When the manager of the project changed, our solution was accepted within a couple of months;
* A medical chatbot. It lasted for a couple of years. The main issue was that there was no well-defined scope - it kept evolving, and there were no real criteria for success. Finally, at some point, the CEO of the company changed; a new one changed most top managers and put most of the projects on hold, including this one;
* A real-time anti-fraud system. It took more than nine months to push it into production. 1-3 months were spent working with data and experimenting with the models; the rest was spent preparing the features for real-time inference and dealing with internal systems.

djch1989,"Hey OP, please take care of your mental health and try to get in some physical activity everyday. 

Imposter syndrome is quite common in this domain.

Let me tell you this and I do not say it just to console you. Domain knowledge, stakeholder management and communication skills really matter a lot.

Is it hard to imagine a better model getting built with a simple algorithm with better incorporation of features knowing causal relationships compared to a fancy model where this was missing?

People like to work with people who are humble, helpful and open to suggestions, most importantly,a genuine interest in helping the business and the team. 

I think you can do these pretty easily. 

To the contrary, people dislike DS/DA who have a cocky attitude and a condescending tone, no matter how knowledgeable they are.

Unless you are in ML research, it's not like you have to invent a new algorithm and even the ones who do that working there take significant time to come up with it if they do. 

It may feel intimidating seeing what everyone else is doing. But just as that, remember there are people who are feeling FOMO and self doubt seeing what you have managed to do. 

It seems that you have a lot of anxiety at this point and unfortunately, that creates a vicious circle.

I will tell you what worked for me once when I was going through a pretty bad time in work life - creating to do lists, ruthlessly focusing on them everyday and stopping my mind getting diverted to thoughts that brought anxiety. I started doing this after battling anxiety and depression for 5-6 months. I was dealing with an abusive boss at the workplace and also, a new role that had a lot of people interaction & politics which overwhelmed me. After I started doing what I mentioned, I got better in 2-3 months and I still keep the habit of to-do lists. Whenever things feel a lot, I just break down the big tasks into small tasks and sub tasks, then go one at a time.

Best of luck, OP!",9/2/2024 15:08,ll5muzz,1f73w6p,datascience,t5_2sptq,POSITIVE

Dekasa,"Man, that's pretty open-ended.  This currently sounds a lot like what I do, but I can tell you a major issue with my work is creating/utilizing actionable insights.  There's a big gap between ""These people have poor outcomes"" and ""If we do this, we can improve outcomes.""

&#x200B;

I'd ask if you have just claims data or if you have that data transformed into something like member level performance on quality measures?  The first is extremely messy, whereas the second is better.  If you have member level detail, you can use those outcomes as your definition of 'improvement.'   It also makes it easy to stratify by a lot of things (age, gender, race, etc.).  If your state is like mine, they love to see that stuff.

&#x200B;

For example, one national quality measure is Follow-up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness.  It's pretty much people who were admitted for a MH diagnosis, and whether they get an outpatient visit soon after they're discharged.  You can look at things like ""What hospitals tend to have people get follow-ups?  What diagnoses tend to get follow-ups?  Can we determine if there are enough MH providers to give follow-ups?""  Then you can look at whether hospitals are referring people out, or whether people diagnosed with depression need more care to go to their follow-up appointments, or whether you need to incentive MH providers to get people in quickly.  It's really a lot of root-cause analysis, I partner with several program managers to get their opinion on why a measure is low, then see if that's reflected in the data.  For example, an administrative model on depression screening may only consider claims that bill specific codes, but some providers don't bill those codes (but do have them in their own system/EPIC).  We took some of them and refined their billing practices to show the codes and the rates shot up, even though no extra 'work' was happening, we were just measuring it more accurately.  

I would say that hopefully you have some direction on what to work on.  There are 11 Core measures, and 20+ beyond those.  If in doubt, send out text messages for medication management and well visits :)

I hope that's at least somewhat helpful.  This work can be super non-directional and a lot of work can end up going down paths that don't lead anywhere.",7/29/2024 18:13,lfivv7v,1ef5m10,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

Each training image was seen once, with continual learning (and no notion of batching). Furthermore, the number of training images actually used for learning was substantially smaller10 than 10,000; because active learning admits only those informative images that reduce expected free energy.

PurpleViking94,"Hello guys, see if y'all can help me with some direction here, I'll try to be short:

I'm 30y old and I have around 8 years of experience in the UX/UI design field. I don't have a degree, never saw the necessity of having one since in the tech field experience counts way more than having one. Recently, I started being way more interested in the analytics field than in the design itself, so I started looking into the Data Science field.

When I started researching into all the subdivisions of the field, I believe the Business Analytics is one where I most see myself into (at least to start and get more experience), since I'm already kinda of doing part of it at my current job (analyzing market industries, looking for patterns on it and trying to tell a customer if their business has more chance to be profitable or not - in a very summarized way).

So, here are a few of my questions:

1) Since I'm already 30 (I know it's not super old, but I'm also not on my early 20s anymore) and I don't have a degree, do I have a chance to be successful on this field? Is a BS or MS really required to land a good job?

2) I'm not trying to spend a car price in bootcamps, so I'm looking for smaller courses where I could get more knowledge. I saw a few ones like this one from Microsoft on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-business-analyst), this one on Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098) and this last one on Harvard Business School Online (https://online.hbs.edu/courses/business-analytics/). Is any of those courses worth it? I don't have real work experience, so I'd like to do courses that would in fact prepare me to work on the field and not lot a bunch of theory.

I got a Ab test a couple months ago because afaik I’ve never had COVID and wanted to know for sure. My PCP seemed to think it was a waste of time. 

Results showed I have zero antibodies from infection, but over 25,000 (the range doesn’t go any higher) UI/ml from the vaccine—and that’s *months* after the last vaccine I’d had, which for most people the Ab count would be around 5,000-7,500. That might explain why every jab (including last Friday) results in a quite significant, yet short-lived,  reaction. Ugh. 

It’s interesting that there’s still no consensus as to what Ab levels constitute adequate protection.

jm3546,"Same here. Every time this subject gets brought up on reddit it's treated like their are zero positives about going into the office for both the employee and the employer and all company leadership are tyrants just trying to make their employees miserable, and like it's very obviously not true. 

For the employee, making actual work friends completely remote is pretty difficult and in person it's pretty easy if you make the bare minimum effort to socialize. Working with people you like makes the work a lot more enjoyable and when conflict comes up (it's just a natural part of the workplace) it's much easier to work through it when you like the people you work with. 

Being in office also helps getting face time with upper middle management and leadership. There were several times when I was an entry level employee where I stayed past 5:30 because I wanted to finish something and someone from a leadership position walked by and noticed, asked what I was working on and struck up a conversation and it obviously made a good impression. That doesn't happen when you are remote. 

And for me personally, one of the nice things about being in office is being able to mentally separate from work when I go home and just not worry about it. Remote work blurs the lines of work and life because work happens in your own personal space at home. 

For the employer, you hear a lot of WFH absolutelists argue that WFH is more productive and being in office is a waste, but hate to break it to them but leadership aren't just tyrants and are actually mostly greedy and want higher productivity and know that WFH is on average less productive. Some employees thrive remote, but for the most part, people are somewhere between a little less productive and quite a bit less productive but they enjoy a more relaxed environment. If WFH was so much better from a productivity standpoint between employees working harder and now the company doesn't need all this pricey office space, leadership at large companies wouldn't have started mandating employees come back in. 

I've managed people who were on hybrid schedules and both people who hated being in office and people who didn't mind it, did better work and were more productive in office. It's not complicated, there are plenty of distractions or other things you can do during WFH (playing with pets, looking after kids, turning on the TV while you work, doing laundry, etc.), in the office you can work, catch up with coworkers or sit at your desk and not work (but when you are stuck at the office, people would rather do work than be bored so they work). I think a lot of people have trouble distinguishing between ""I am more productive remote"" vs. ""I just hate my job way less when I'm remote"" 


I think a hybrid approach is best because employees do like having at least a couple of days WFH for the flexibility. You get the team building side with a few days in office but it also seems like a fair middle ground between employer and employee.",9/17/2024 1:40,lni7vnp,1fi71ez,technology,t5_2qh16,POSITIVE

However, before the \`transformers\` library, you would find basically no where that would deal with tokenizing/ adding the tokens for you, you literally had to have code like

end = '\[102\]'

mask = '\[MSK\]'

and put it into your input strings...

If you read the paper without noticing how the end tokens were used or that you needed to put a ""NSP"" token when training in a certain regime tough luck, it just would not work with no obvious reasons why the output tokens were insanely wacky.

It is hard to emphasize how hard it was to replicate ML papers frankly at all except some which used toolboxes in Matlab etc. I'm genuinely not sure that without HuggingFace we'd have seen that change.

He is not staring at the screen the whole time, just occasionally checking in that they can see the toy he’s showing. 

I have been in two minds on whether I should put limits on this, but I think the interaction with grandparents is more valuable than the “omg screen time” part.

quietIntensity,"AI is mostly hype and BS at this point though. It is a solution looking for problems to solve. There are specific things it is useful for, but a lot of things that it is not really useful for yet and won't be for quite a while. The fact that they have to be trained on existing content and can only generate answers based on existing knowledge, limits their usefulness in significant ways. 

I use a couple of the generative AIs to help with programming tasks, but not in an official manner. I have to interact with them on my personal equipment, then type the useful parts of their answers into my work laptop. With the quality of search engine results declining, the generative AIs often work as a better search engine for finding out how other people have solved various problems. 

There is a distinct point though, past which it doesn't know the answers, but it also isn't programmed to be able to say ""I don't know"", so it will only generate the best bullshit answer it can. It will fudge together multiple products into a single non-existing product that does solve your problem, and then provide you an answer as though that thing it hallucinated actually exists. When you type that code into your IDE, it's going to fail and it's probably not something you can tweak into working properly either. This is its true limitation when it comes to innovation. If the answer to your question isn't already known or close to known by combining other known information, the AI answers become pointless garbage.

AquaWitch0715,"Like the article says, it's pretty much something we've known about for a long time.

And I'm sorry for the ensuing rant, but this wasn't speculation. It isn't hypothetical or theoretical.

Things wear out. Ancient roads dating back to long-fallen civilizations were found to have been built to last, and they were maintained, as needed by the empire. 

They didn't have an exponential ""boom"" of traffic that required updates, and they didn't let them fall into disrepair or wash away after one torrential storm swept through the area. 

Everything has a finite amount of usage. Roads. Phones. Power grids. Schools. Buildings. Government. Corporations. Businesses. Employees. 

And humans.

With required upkeep and maintenance, you can maybe extend its overall longevity. Not double it (x2) or extend it beyond the physical limitations of reality.

The attitude of this world is to forget that everything we have, start to finish, requires investment and proper maintenance.

If you look at railroad tracks, you can see that the western part of the U.S. drastically has less coverage than the eastern coast.

What would be the point of adding more sections and tracks, when we have alternatives?

Well, we'd certainly need the alternatives when the current tracks fall into disrepair and we need to halt shipping.

I only hope that everything doesn't altogether collapse like Dominos, because this whole system has been relying on outdated, ancient products and services, to increase short-term gain,and shortcut the debt to everyone and everything involved.",9/10/2024 2:20,lmdn1kt,1fd0d3o,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

This tool was designed and built to save security analysts the time they'd normally spend cross referencing against multiple IOC databases. It most certainly is not ""regurgitator shit"". Especially when you consider the other info it provides alongside the reputation checking. 

Further, it will accept far more data types than most individual IOC platforms. It was designed to be as easy to use as a Google search ie one box and one click no matter what you throw into it.

The data is taken directly from the primary sources and is not changed in any way.

The only issue is that it still repeats the prompt as part of its generation before the rest of its response. I know that I have to train it on the concatenated prompt + completion then mask out the prompt for loss, but not sure why it still generates the prompt before responding.

You mentioned that the normal distribution works well for the heights of people, but what isn’t mentioned is that people don’t have a height of 0. So, there isn’t really a “floor” for heights, and the distribution has more space to accommodate the normal distribution.

The data you are analyzing naturally allows for many data points to be at or near 0. I believe the reason you are observing many skewed distributions is that you’re looking at data where the default value is, in fact, 0. For example, a baby is born with height but not with money.

My point is that there wouldn't be ""hundreds of thousands of entry level jobs"" doing this.

To build, renovate, upgrade and repair modern bridges you are going to need entry level talent working from 5-10 years to appropriately skill up. The ACoE doesn't do anything small. Any bridges that they would be invested in are bigger than state and municipal construction. None of those projects would be a wise tax spend for entry level work. Hell, I don't think it would get past legal.

If you are arguing to make a national program like Americorp to train 100,000 specialists in how to make modern bridges sure. Marry the programs to local trade schools and colleges. Pay everyone to be full time students and forgive the debt over 5 years of service.

Then they'll make massive modern bridges. They might also make wider roads over culverts so we don't need more bridges.

sloppyredditor,"For what it's worth, I agree with a lot of the points you've made... but for shits and giggles I'm going to play devil's advocate (also for the sake of discussion).

FWIW, I'm thinking this is a precursor to the government spending a LOT on cyber contracts.

Point: Cannabis intolerance is a major disqualifier

Counterpoints: Without hard numbers to back it up, you're disqualifying maybe 33% of the candidate pool. It's very difficult to fire a fed, & much easier to drop someone as a contractor (private employee working in a public space). When you take something like cannabis usage in the private sector, you're allowing your HR and management teams to use judgment in whether it's inhibiting the performance of an employee, making it easier to fire them. Gov't can't do the same as easily.

Point: Compensation sucks

Counterpoints: While a pension isn't the end-all, it's a pretty damn good perk. Gov't employees get discounts everywhere, lowering the bills. Training is part of compensation and it's essentially guaranteed in DoD cyber. There's also the point that some people want to serve the public and have a sense of patriotism with it; this need isn't met if you're working for insurance or retail. You also get all the holidays.

Point: Can't work remotely

Counterpoint: Do you want the U.S. government - who can't effectively punish Equifax or NPD for basically violating the privacy rights of almost every U.S. citizen - enabling remote access for people who will have the same massive access rights as someone working in cyber? Field offices are a good option here, but office space is expensive.

Point: Application process is a year

Counterpoint: 3-letter agencies don't want to hire a Snowden, and we know other countries are trying to infiltrate with brilliant tactics... Is it a year in all cases, or is that anecdotal? ...damn. I really have a hard time finding another counter here. (A year is ***insane***, considering it takes practically no time for the military to put grenades in your hand.

Valetion,"Hi! That was my post. I've been pretty vocal about the decline in quality since June, and figured I'd take a moment to post the comment that I've been sharing around this subreddit here.

\_

I will never stop talking about this. There was an update back in June that completely, utterly, and devastatingly sucked the life out of the AI. Every single bot became dry, bland, and tasteless overnight, and the devs have yet to fix it or comment on it

It's pretty obvious that ***something*** in June drastically changed how bots respond, I mean, there's complaints about it almost every single day. The AI didn't just all of a sudden ""*learn*"" to be as brain dead as it is right now, as quickly as it did. Even the worst bots had their own unique personality, and were creative enough to write entertaining responses to single-sentence prompts.

Prior to the LLM update, you could have creative and immersive conversations/roleplays without needing to hold the AI's hands to get anywhere. Bots had personality that was unique to how they were trained and designed by the creator, and the AI was so realistic that it almost felt human.

If you go back and look at the post history on this subreddit for the month of June, the servers were down for almost two days straight. Immediately afterwards, the changes in the bots were evident— it was like a night and day difference. I've been extremely vocal about the sudden decline in quality ever since. Marie told us that we'd get an ""*update*"" about the LLM quality issues, but at this point, I no longer believe what they say.

Ever since what happened in June, the bots have been lifeless shells of their former selves, and I have lost all faith that things will ever return to how they used to be, especially considering that [~~they're planning on using external LLM's~~](https://blog.character.ai/our-next-phase-of-growth/) (They have already started using off-the-shelf LLM's that they are currently doing a/b group testing on, and are no longer using the Noam model.)

>*As we enter this next phase of growth, we will continue to invest in our post-training capabilities, with the flexibility to use our own or externally available LLMs. We are excited for the future of* [*Character.AI*](http://Character.AI)*, and are committed to serving our users through innovative new products.*",9/19/2024 19:55,lnxvcbc,1fkpwjd,CharacterAI,t5_6xtffe,NEGATIVE

ellaregee,"Fresher Q: is it always like this? 

HI - I'm new to Reddit and new to Data Science - so if I am doing something here I shouldn't be - please course correct. 

I left a 20+ year in communications and marketing (all channels  - tv, radio, print, digital, etc) to do data science. I am not sure I love it/like it. So I'd like to ask the community if this is what it's like everywhere, or just my experience. 

I did a DS bootcamp about 2 years ago. Landed a job as a data analyst right out of bootcamp. I've been in DA role for a little over a year. I understand (mostly) the difference between a data scientist and data analyst. I often compare it to ""doctor vs nurse"". I knew when I took this role I was an analyst. 

These are the things I struggle with and want to know ""is it like this everywhere?"":

* I mostly pull marketing data. I use a very frustrating email campaign tool to pull email audiences.  Sometimes I use SQL to pull data. 
* In my analyst role, I do hardly any modelling. I can do modelling and enjoy it! When I have brought it to attention - I often get the ""we don't need"" or ""we don't have budget"" response. 
* I do no campaign analysis - the other part of my team that does this is basically populating a spreadsheet looking at p-value. I can do so much more than this, but again, ""not my lane"". 
* I have done a few side projects that involved bigger analyses - sentiment analysis, NPS vs credit-card-holder,  but I had to initiate those myself and I often feel like I get the side-eye of ""we don't have budget for this"" or ""not interested"". Also, I haven't had the chance to see my modeling work implemented into a 'real life' situation so I can't say that my work ""created a 50% increase in email open rates"" - those quantitative facts that look good on resumes. I can make a ton of suggestions of what to do with my results but those generally seem to go no where. 
* I do a ton of lackluster reporting which involves running pre-written SQL code (now Big Query code) and literally copy and pasting outputs into another spreadsheet. There has been little interest in moving this to a dynamic dashboard environment. 

I want a role where I can use my communications skills and data modelling skills together to inform strategy, answer questions, or uncover hidden gems in the story of the data. 

Is there a specific job role out there that has a stong emphasis on the communications side of data? Are all analyst roles like this? And should I start being much more specific in job hunting looking more towards the ""scientist""/modelling side of this career path?",5/28/2024 19:40,l62i8nd,1d1ixm4,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

xTRYPTAMINEx,"Indeed, which they could generate by having a smoothly run company with well paid workers who don't leave and actually care about the well being of the company.

By not having to pay dividends, it frees up insane amounts of money to pay workers properly, and directly. Shares mean nothing to someone who is considering leaving due to their quality of life being eroded every day through siphoning of wealth, potentially not being able to afford a normal existence, or not owning a home.

Valve Corporation is a privately owned company that is worth billions of dollars. Know what their lowest wage was in 2021? Around 400k per year. 181 game devs making an average of 1 million a year. 79 Steam devs making an average of 960k a year. 41 Hardware developers making an average of 430k a year. The even funnier thing is, there's limited executives(who still make an average of 4.5 million a year). No one is the boss of anyone else at Valve when it comes to the people creating the products, teams within valve can straight up choose to ignore project managers. It's one of the most successful companies of all time, and arguably the most successful game company of all time.

Sure, in most cases you would need laws in order to implement this, as there aren't many people like Gabe Newell in the world who actually pay people well. However, he's also one of the only insanely wealthy people who doesn't just siphon wealth from the people creating the products for the company he owns. The workers own the company alongside Newell and Valve execs. Newell owns just over 50% in order to retain control. Removing public shareholders/dividends doesn't remove wealth from workers unless you specifically make it that way.

Your claim is absolute bullshit. The world only operates the way it does because wealthy people have collectively done everything in their power in order to seize the wealth generated by workers, to keep for themselves, despite not being able to generate that wealth on their own. Anyone in the world can siphon wealth from a public company, instead of benefiting the workers who create the wealth. So please stop pretending that the system and mindset forced on us is the best system, where workers somehow don't create literally almost all of the value of a company and shouldn't benefit from it. It's not, never will be, and never has been the best system. Valve proved that.

- Econometrics I, II, & III (Multi Linear Regression, Time Series, Least squares and maximum likelihood estimation, Identification issues, fixed and random effects, instrumental variables, and a bunch of other stuff)

- Computing in Economics (Programming and Economic Analysis)

- Game Theory

- Calc 1

- Linear Algebra

Along with the Data Science minor which has courses in database management, algorithms, random programming, and statistics classes.

I could also do a Masters in Data Science. Not looking to dive in right away just wondering if this degree applies to Data Science, and how difficult it'll be to get a data-related job with this education.

General_Service_8209,"I had a project about building annML model for finding anomalies in the telemetry data from a large piece of machinery that I think illustrates this well. This is a very specific example, but pretty much all work with large scale datasets causes very similar problems eventually.

On the one side, you have the ML model, which can only process continuous, numeric data, always needs the same type of it, and needs the values to be normalised to get good performance. Pretty strict requirements, but nothing too crazy.

But on the other side, the telemetry data was built over the course of almost a decade, with several database migrations in between, sensors being added and removed, values that used to be co start changing because of new upgrades, and so on and so on. Within a lot of values that did exist for the whole time, there were also differences like their numeric precision or data types changing, or stuff like string annotations from engineers with no consistent format.

And finally, you could only retrieve 1000 or so values at once, otherwise your query would time out, because „I don’t know, it just does that for some reason, I didn’t build it“ according to my supervisor.

So a lot of the challenges was figuring out stuff like distinguishing betweenness sensor losing its connection (which is an anomaly) vs its data missing because the sensor wasn’t installed yet? If it is normal that a temperature sensor reads higher values after a machine upgrade, should the ML model be trained on its data before the upgrade or not? How do you parse the strings? Does it make sense to do so at all?

All of these problems are solvable when you have a manageable dataset size and can check over everything, but doing it at scale is what makes them really difficult. (In my case, this was literally hundreds of sensors, with hundreds of thousands or millions of measurements each) It’s way harder to get a feeling for what a data augmentation or other step does when you, in many cases, can’t reasonably even look at individual features because there are too many of them.",9/15/2024 13:46,ln8uhgu,1fhc5sv,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

vHAL_9000,"Hezbollah was a Shia milita that was created by the IRGC during the Lebanese civil war. Their ideological goal was to export the ideology of the Islamic Revolution, which places the Iranian supreme leader under the concept of the ""Velayat-e-Faqih"". In their interpretation of Twelver Shiism, this makes the supreme leader the ultimate living religious authority, as a replacement for the line of Imams, like the Pope. All other Twelver Shia reject this. They see Velayat-e-Faqih as a mandate for a multitude of clerics to guide those who have no guidance, such as orphans. 

Their military goal was to be a proxy force. Hezbollah received immense support from Iran and Syria (who had invaded and occupied Lebanon). They competed with and eventually even militarily attacked the Lebanese Shia faction, Amal. Having control over Shia areas grandfathered them in to the government services provided previously by the government, locals, or Amal. After the end of the civil war, they were the only faction who did not disarm.

They're not a charity, but a quasi-state. They control the local governments and get to spend the tax revenue as they wish. The money they receive from Iran and other foreign donors goes mostly towards their military efforts.

All of the social services they ever operated are in Shia-majority areas. They are discriminatory towards Shia rivals who do not subscribe to the guardianship of the supreme leader of Iran. They use social services to entice people to join and vote for them, meticulously screening for political rivals. The main benefactors of their services are their party members, fighters and their families. Their schools teach their ideology: Khomeinism, anti-Zionism and Shia Islamism.

UHF Pagers don't use the cell phone network and you can't use them to receive SMS. They are surprisingly expensive, purpose-built machines that require separate transmitters.

dspivothelp,"**TL;DR: How can an unemployed, experienced analytics-focused data scientist get out of analytics and pivot to a more quantitative position?**

I'm a data scientist with a Master's in Statistics and nine years of experience in a tech city.  I've had the title Senior Data Scientist for two of them.  I was laid off from my job of four years last month and have been dealing with what some would call a ""first world problem"" in the current market.

**I get callbacks from many recruiters, but almost all of them are for analytics positions.**  This makes sense because (as I'll explain below) I've been repeatedly pushed into analytics roles at my past jobs, and I've barely gotten to flex my stats muscles.  My resume reflects this, as most of my accomplishments are along the lines of ""designed a big metric"" or ""was the main DS who drove X internal initiative"".  I've been blowing away every A/B testing interview and get feedback indicating that I clearly have a lot of experience in that area.  I've also been told in performance reviews and in interview loops that I write very good code in Python, R, and SQL.

However, **I don't like analytics.**  It's almost all very basic A/B testing on product changes.  More importantly, I've found that most companies have a terrible experimentation culture.  When I prod in interviews, they often indicate that their A/B testing platform is underdeveloped to the point where many tests are analyzed offline, or that they only test things that are likely to be a certain win.  They ignore network effects, don't use holdout groups or meta-analysis, and insist that tests designed to answer a very specific question should also be used to answer a ton of other things.

**I've been trying to find a job more focused on some at least one of causal inference, explanatory statistical modeling, Bayesian statistics, and ML on tabular data (i.e. not LLMs, but like fraud prediction).**  I've never once gotten a callback for an ML Engineer position, which makes sense because I have minimal ML experience.  I had one HR call for a company that does identity validation and fraud prediction, but they passed on me for someone with more fraud prediction experience.

**My experience with the above areas is as follows.**  These were approaches that I tried but ended up having no impact, except for the first one, which I didn't get to finish:

* Designed requirements for a regression model.  Did a ton of internal research, then learned SparkSQL and wrote code to pull and extract the features.  However, after this, I was told to design experiments for the model rather than writing the actual code to train it.  Another data scientist on my team did the model training with people on another team that claimed ownership.

* Used a causal inference approach to match treatment group users to control group users for an experiment where we were expecting the two groups to be very different due to selection bias.  However, the selection bias ended up being a non-issue.

* Did clustering on time-dependent data in order to identify potential subgroups of users to target.  Despite it taking about two days to do, I was criticized for not doing something simpler and less statistical.  (Also, in hindsight, the results didn't replicate when I slightly changed the data.)

* Discussed an internal fraud model with stakeholders.  Recognized that a dead simple feature wasn't in it and added it myself, which boosted recall at 99% precision by like 40%.  However, even after my repeated prodding, the production model was never updated due to lack of engineering support and because the author of the proprietary ML framework quit.

* During a particularly dead month, I spent time building a Bayesian model for an internal calculation in Stan.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to get it to scale, and ran into major computational issues that - in hindsight - likely indicated an issue with the model formulation in the paper I tried to implement.

At the time I was laid off I had about six months of expenses saved up, plus fairly generous severance and unemployment.  **How should I proceed to get one of these more technical positions?**  Some ideas I have:

* List the above projects on my resume even though they failed.  However, that's inevitably going to come up in an interview.

* I could work on a project focused on Bayesian statistics or causal inference.  However, I worry that pausing my job search will make me less employable as time goes on.  I'm also worried about being unemployed in Q4, when hiring is really slow, and when I expect my savings to start running out.

* Take an analytics job and wait for an opening with a particular company to occur.  Someone fairly big in my city's DS community that knows I can handle more technical work said he'd refer me and probably be able to skip most of the interview process, but his company currently has no open DS positions and he said he doesn't know when more will open up.

* Take a 3 or 6-month contract position focused on my interests from one of the random third party recruiters on LinkedIn.  It'll probably suck, but give me experience I can use for a new job.

Additionally, here's a summary of my work experience:

* Company 1 (roughly 200 employees).  First job out of grad school.  I was there for a year and was laid off because there ""wasn't a lot of DS work"".  I had a great manager who constantly advocated for me, but couldn't convince upper management to do anything beyond basic tabulation.  For example, he pitched a cluster analysis and they said it sounded hard.

* Company 2 (roughly 200 employees).  I was there for two years. 
 Shortly after joining I started an ML project, but was moved to analytics due to organizational priorities.  Got a phenomenal performance review, asked if I could take on some ML work, and was given an unambiguous no.  Did various analytics tasks (mostly dashboarding and making demos) and mini-projects on public data sources due to lack of internal data (long story).  Spent a full year searching for a more modeling-focused position because a lot of the DS was smoke and mirrors and we weren't getting any new data.  After that year, I quit and ended up at Company 3.

* Company 3 (roughly 30000 employees).  I was there for six years.  I joined because my future manager (Manager #1) told me I'd get to pick my team and would get to do modeling.  Instead, after I did a trial run on two teams over three months, I was told that a reorg meant I would no longer get to pick my team and ended up on a team that needed drastic help with experimentation.  Although my manager (Manager #2) had some modeling work in mind for me, she eventually quit.  Manager #3 repeatedly threw me to the wolves and had me constantly working on analyzing experiments for big initiatives while excluding me from *planning* said experiments.  He also gave me no support when I tried to push back against unrealistic stakeholder demands, and insisted I work on projects that I didn't think would have long-term impact due to organizational factors.  However, I gained a lot of experience with messy data.  I told his skip during a 1:1 that I wanted to do more modeling, and he insisted I keep pushing him for those opportunities.

    Manager #3 drove me to transfer to another team, which was a much better experience.  Manager #4 was the best manager I ever had and got me promoted, but also didn't help me find modeling opportunities.  Manager #5 was generally great and found me a modeling project to work on after I explained that lack of modeling work was causing burnout.  It was a great project at first, but he eventually pushed me to work only on the experimental aspects of that modeling project.  I never got to finish it because another team took it over.",7/2/2024 21:17,lbchwfa,1dsjugi,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

AsterionDB,"Unfortunately, given the way operating systems are designed coupled with the file system - a 60 year old legacy technology - its real hard to prevent this sort of thing.

The file system was originally designed to look like a file cabinet back when we had to organize .5Meg of data on a floppy. Therefore, it has to provide a mechanism that makes it easy for us 'humans' to manage the layout of data - and even more importantly - find things when we've forgotten where we put them.

Think about it, the fact that the file system is full of static file names that mean something to you and I is one of the primary reasons why we face the current cybersecurity crisis. You probably have a directory labeled ""top secret, don't look here"" (e.g. /home/user/.ssh)

The operating system, the basic design of which has been around for about 50 years, is really nothing more than a program loader and a means of interfacing to hardware. Note that I said a program loader. A program is not the same as an enterprise application. Programs are things like PDF viewers, media players, a video editor, Photoshop etc. etc.

Turns out, the file-system/operating-system is a terrible level at which to write enterprise applications. All you need to do to verify that fact is look at what's happening today. The problem is, we have a huge amount of apparatus and mindshare built around the the FS/OS as a 'platform' for all of our programming.

What we need to do is create an entirely new 'layer' on top of the FS/OS the provides a software development platform for enterprise applications. Such an apparatus  isolates the programmer, largely, from the pitfalls and failings of the FS/OS.

There's a lot of playing around with huge blocks of dense layers or whatever existing structure has worked before, and not a lot of ""I think this problem is a quadratic problem on this intermediate parameter, let's fit to those parameters then introduce a quadratic layer""

This will probably worsen your loss and everyone hates that, but what you gain in interpretability is huge.

Like, let's say you're modeling disease spread. Disease spread is fundamentally an interaction between healthy people and sick people. So you start with a markov chain with 5 states - healthy, sick, vaccine-immune, recovered-immune, dead. Now you could just do an RNN with 5->10->20->10->5 (or powers of 2) params that unwraps to 3-4 generations of disease spread and use that to figure out the time progression. And that would probably work. 

But if you instead explicitly do the polynomial layers, 5-> 25-> 5, you're going to get better results. Even better, you can discount some things that shouldn't matter - really, the big one is gonna be healthy people getting infected by sick people. You could do dead x healthy to capture people getting scared, or healthy x healthy to capture birth rate. But you *know* ahead of time that maybe 4-6 out of the 25 possible interactions are gonna matter.

(You can check this a little bit using interpretability tools, and yeah, this is dropout with extra steps, but I've personally seen people go up to 4096 and back down for a problem that's fundamentally physics with no powers more than quadratic, and I'm sure big companies are using massively more than that.)",9/11/2024 20:23,lmnsjj7,1fefhrz,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

OpenAITutor,"LLMs (Large Language Models) have generated a lot of buzz, but whether they're worth the investment for you depends on a few factors:



1. \*\*Growing Industry Adoption\*\*: LLMs are rapidly being applied across industries for customer support, content generation, code automation, and more. If you believe LLMs will continue to disrupt these sectors, developing expertise in LLM training, fine-tuning, and deployment could make you highly marketable.



2. \*\*Complementing Your Skillset\*\*: With your data science and ML background, LLM knowledge could complement your existing skills. LLMs are becoming a crucial part of the AI toolkit, and integrating them with traditional methods (e.g., RAG, hybrid models) is where significant innovation is happening.



3. \*\*Business Value Uncertainty\*\*: You're right to question their business impact. While LLMs are powerful, the ROI isn’t always immediate or clear-cut. For some businesses, traditional ML models might still deliver better results in terms of revenue and operational efficiency. However, the potential of LLMs in automating complex workflows and generating actionable insights is undeniable and growing.



4. \*\*Alternative Areas of Study\*\*: If your goal is business value and practical outcomes, other fields like MLOps, causal inference, or business-focused areas of ML (e.g., demand forecasting, churn prediction) might provide more immediate value. These areas are more established in driving ROI.



In summary, LLMs are certainly not overhyped but may not immediately displace traditional methods in all cases. If your interest in LLMs aligns with industry trends and your existing skills, it’s likely a worthwhile investment. If you're seeking immediate, proven business outcomes, other areas might offer more concrete returns in the short term. It’s all about balancing your personal interest with business relevance.",9/10/2024 0:01,lmd0a8a,1f9orpk,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

Legitimate question, I never saw anything especially iffy in any fitness content I watch but I suppose it's not unrealistic that some of it would be really messed up. EDIT - forgot about all the stuff promoting steroids and whatnot, tbh I was thinking about workout routine videos.

I just always worry about this type of stuff given how the internet looks now compared to in my youth. People are heavily incentivized self censor in ways that make 90s tv seem like the wild west
 The threat of demonetization has led to dark topics in general often being off limits, true crime videos are liable to have basically all the crime related terms censored, or alleged victims speaking out on stuff will talk about being abused and not be able to actually say what they're accusing the person of, just a bunch of acronyms and soundalikes.

I don't think fitness videos for teens are the end of the world, but considering that there are people who push for huge stretches like classifying all LGBT related content as porn, I can't help but wonder how it will be abused now.

- For image clustering, use Deep clustering methods such as DEC, IDEC or DCN, or newer derivates. They combine autoencoder training and clustering.
- For text clustering, its best to use a pretrained transformer to acquire contextual embeddings. Also take a look at other unsupervised methods such as Topic Modeling.

Environctr24556dr5,"What is nuts is the majority of older animation studios have sold their work offices over the years and the upgrades should allow 'more' animators to work together remotely around the world as needed, ai driven projects or not the idea of reducing the workforce will always reduce the end products quality due to ai bringing unforseen issues and misplacing who is responsible for the the most recognized and awarded works.


I personally see a future where there are MORE animators than ever making a successful carerr out of working with an advanced version of flash mx lol or idk what is cool nowadays? But imagine it's 2004 and Trogdor is being generated by ai instead of Homestar Runners choice of software at the time.


Having an ability to pull out a mobile device similar to the new trifold phones are coming out to the public- this portable all in one drawing pad that can handle the workload and offer a beginner a chance to find their speciality through experimenting with different filters and layering options and procedurally generated extra magic that seems to be all the craze at CFO stock meetings or whatever financial jargon you can fill in here I guess. 


Point is, we're all literally on the edge of a new dawn in animation meetups whether through a VR or AR or regular scenario, whether using your own original art work hand drawn then altering it and animating it through various software options and working internationally with storyboard artists, writers, directors, and so on- the fact that we are losing employees to ai is mind boggling unless you realize it's about the money.  


Ai actually is pretty expensive to ""upgrade"" or ""convert"" your company towards achieving some version of minimalistic altruistic accountant stock holder approved version of creating tomorrows masterpieces and works of art.


Think about the robotic hands being designed and programmed to do all sorts of neat things like cook food, move boxes, carry children, sword fight etc, a robotic hand that can paint the Mona Lisa or a robotic hand capable of drawing a perfect blueprint. Movie I, Robot comes to mind.


Connect the dots connecting a brain to a microchip then the robotic hand giving a person without limbs the ability to show the world what they have been wanting to show us all along but could not. 


Losing artists for profits being put towards ai is similar to deciding to build a robot to carry a gun instead of draw works of art.

Thalesian,"Karl Popper’s positivism is the key difference. In science you can’t really prove something, but you can reject competing hypotheses for a phenomena. In other words, science proceeds via negative rejection, slaying one idea at a time until the best (or at least most resistant to falsification cough string theory cough) are left standing.  

AI follows a drastically different path, in which money flows to leverage massive computing power to validate a vision. Generative AI is even weirder - we construct new positives through association. 

So in this sense, the term “data scientist” actually would mean the opposite of what the job actually entails. I imagine if Popper had heard the term, he’d assume you’d spend most of your time demonstrating what can’t be done with the data. 

Though I don’t want anyone to take this as if data scientists are somehow lesser. IMO, the strenuous process of cross-validation and data withholding are marks of better discipline than most scientists practice. I once tried to publish a paper using AI to show that a commonly accepted theory was inadequate to form predictions, and the peer reviewers weren’t able to comprehend cross validation (they called it “fake data”). I do think there is room for a more rigorous concept of the “scientist” part of the word, but as long as most development occurs because of VC money and short term goals, the “data” part will be primary.",5/25/2024 15:08,l5mclx1,1d05mqt,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

Owens_Got_GrayMatter,"I've been doing a lot of work understanding the transition between prompting to production because I've been building a project for parts of it to help. I'll try being as straight as I can without promotion.   
Doesn't matter what you're using, there's a few core things that you could do.  
  
- Guarantee the right output format. Use function calls or chains to ensure that the model returns valid JSON or some other structured data. There's tools for that allow you to define functions that the LLM calls, which can force it to return outputs in a specific format, reducing the chance of errors like hallucinations​​. 

- Ground your model with relevant data. Connect your LLMs to vector stores like Pinecone so you provide the model with relevant data snippets that are more likely to lead to accurate and contextually relevant outputs. 

- Test your prompts like code.  You set up unit tests for catching errors before going live. There's tools (like mine) that allow you to chain prompts together with JavaScript code blocks for additional processing and then test these chains to ensure they meet your criteria. 

- Validate calculations. Generate and then execute code for extra validation. This ensures that outputs are not just accurate but also verifiable, which is particularly useful for data-heavy applications.

- Iterate. Often. When you integrate into production you've still got to tweak and update your prompts. You can create an endpoint (via Soolva for example) so you don't have to redeploy. It's pretty important when you're dealing with the non-deterministic nature of LLMs and need to make continuous improvements​.

There are a few tools that can help with what I've written above. Mine, [soolva.com](http://soolva.com) is focused around all those points - but there are others, some which are more developer focused for example. If you want to give mine ago, DM me, if it doesn't help I'll personally help you though the landscape of other tools.",8/23/2024 9:10,ljinta7,1ez60wf,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,POSITIVE

1. **Identifying and Measuring Attribution**: To effectively track the influence of different decision-makers, you integrate your CRM with marketing automation platforms. In this case, such setup helps in logging interactions across different stages and attributing them correctly to each stakeholder involved. Btw, advanced tools like Salesforce and HubSpot (not a huge fan) offer capabilities to track such engagements comprehensively.
2. **Tracking Word-of-Mouth**: Capturing the impact of word-of-mouth can be challenging, but tools like NPS surveys, customer interviews, and referral tracking can be instrumental. I reemebr on one client we incorporated these qualitative data points into our attribution model, which gave us insights into how much word-of-mouth is influencing buying decisions.
3. **Customizing Attribution Models**: Given the lengthy sales cycles in B2B, it’s crucial to use a time decay or U-shaped attribution model, which can be customized to emphasize the most influential touchpoints, typically the first and last interactions. Adjusting the model based on the feedback from sales about which interactions seem most decisive can further refine your attribution strategy.

Mainly I got by with just trying. Usually things were alright. But I was given a lot of responsibility at a job out of college and I was talking to my dad about how worried I was about how it would go. He said, ""If you screw up, what's the worst they can do to you? Fire you?""

I'm not exactly sure why but those words really helped me. That and ""anyone not making mistakes isn't actually doing anything."" My dad is a pretty smart guy. I stopped being so nervous about failure after he told me those things. It's really the only words that have ever truly helped me.

What I would say is make sure they know it's alright to fail. That the consequences aren't ever as bad as they think they will be. And just be there to help them talk through it and aware that it may not be your fault at all and instead people are giving them guff. People can be assholes when they know something you don't or when you are unable to complete something that they think is simple, but we're all beginners at some point. Sometimes we just don't know things because we never encountered it or no one taught us or we just never had a need for it before.

We sold an additional sale a year later for the iPads to replace their inventory control and scheduling platforms.

Being the systems engineer, I was essentially the nerd on the sales team. I solved issues such as integrating with their existing systems, educating them on how deployment and securing of the devices worked etc etc.

What I liked about it was that I was using my hands on practical IT knowledge from prior in my career but in a way that educated people. At the time, Apple wasn't really used in Enterprise environments like it is now. It was a very exciting time.

Anticode,">What tools can we invent to break down the tribes into smaller factions again?

Great question, good solutions too. Very solarpunk.

The *real* (and hardest) answer is... The core issue is that some things are viewed as ""too human"" to be re-examined, let alone to be established as deeply problematic.

Following the calories/overconsumption analogue, people should become aware on a sociocultural level that ""too much of a good thing"" (is a bad thing) applies to social media too even if it's a bit more abstract than sweets or soda.

People ""should"" know that it's not productive to insulate yourself in echo-chambers, or to find yourself toeing the line at the edge between factions, and they should be aware that the comfortable sensation of deeply relating to *so many people* located so many miles away should be viewed as a troubling warning sign indicating that a critical sociopsychological need for community has been subverted by an addictive desire for 'cultural absolution', of a sort.

I suspect that one reason why cities/urban areas are so consistently ""blue"" is because consistent exposure to large numbers of highly sociodemographically varied human beings demonstrates on a deeply psychological level that The Enemy is an abstraction, a sort of 'evolutionary phantasm' that once kept us close to a shared campfire... Inversely, rural areas evoke the opposite outcome, where physical isolation and cultural uniformity only magnifies the idea that The Enemy is truly, undeniably ""out there somewhere"" *and* ""is not like Us"".

In that context, even with social media magnifying healthy human desire for socialization/union into a sort of tumor, inadvertent exposure to reality helps negate the risk of it becoming a full-blown cancer. But even the metaphorical cancer isn't the last stop on the nightmare train.

The danger is when that ever-present tumor becomes a comfortably familiar cancer that is *then* inexplicably believed to be some sort of new and vital organ. At that point, that Dangerous Thing is defended as if part of the self. Any risk it carries is ignored or even cherished, protected viciously even as it self-perpetuates (manifesting as rabid, shortform shouts into social media... ""This is the way things are!"", ""I hate [thing]!"", ""Kill all [whatever]!"".

An organ does things, it serves a purpose. A cancer only spreads. What good is performed by metaphorical ""screaming"" except signaling that danger is near and that action is required? 

I digress.

But yes, the core issue is that some things are viewed as ""too human"" to be re-examined, let alone to be established as deeply problematic. Hunger is normal, so what's wrong with eating an entire cake? Union is normal, so what's wrong with mindless conformity?",9/18/2024 20:20,lnsggzc,1fjlnun,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

pizzainoven,"They don't quite all get their own office anymore, good deal of employees share offices, but you're completely right that there's no open office plan because the CEO is against that. 

The bad thing is that the CEO is completely against remote work of any type and has even cut down on the policies that would allow managers to authorize employees to work from home when there's bad weather (The office is in Wisconsin, so at least a few times every year there's winter weather in which people who are non-essential should stay off the road) 

They also require employees to work in the office even if they have a dedicated work customer located on the other side of the country (making flights to Utah from Wisconsin every week for example, instead of having employees just live near the customers they support) 

They hire pretty much exclusively new college graduates for their technology related roles. They ask for your SAT/ ACT scores and college graduation information, so they know exactly how old you are and don't hire people who aren't new college grads. They have a lot of control over the employees this way because they've never worked anywhere else.

>Does anyone have experience with making the transition from neuroscience to data science?  
my background was in semi-conductor physics, but met plenty of neuroscientists, but did make a similar transition. However, I had the big advantage of graduating in a stronger economy where people were more willing to take a risk on someone without industry experience. 

  
>would people balk at my lack of business focused problem-solving experience?   
Some will, and I would also assume there is a fair amount of academia that needs to be drilled out of you. some key pointsers:

1. really understand how the business works - how do they make money and why should they care?2. leave ""interesting"" at the door - the phrase is ""actionable"". You should mentally followup every piece of analysis with something like ""... and because of {previous} we recommend the business do XXX""  
3. you will need to make decisions in the face of uncertainty. the sample size was never quite big enough, some glitch impacted X percent of users so we aren't sure if we can use that analysis, etc etc. As an academic, its pretty drilled into our heads that we need to do some really sophisticated experiment and/or analysis to really tease out some measurement with clarity - generally not the case in industry (with exceptions!)

  
In terms of helpful advice, I would consider the following questions:

illuhad,"Seems like there are some misconceptions here.

>You need to compile the source code on each and every platform to create binary files. And this is a huge issue.

Not true. This is only the case with the Intel SYCL compiler (DPC++). AdaptiveCpp, another SYCL compiler, has a generic code representation and can JIT from that code representation to Intel/NVIDIA/AMD GPUs. So you only compile the code once.

>You don't depend on each vendor to implement their compilers. While you do need to optimize critical kernels for different vendors - vast majority of the code is platform independent. If you need to have a sycl compiler for: nVidia, AMD, Intel, Mali, Apple M1, PowerVR and expect that each of them actually support this tech. While OpenCL is well supported by everybody (even nVidia), like OpenGL and nowadays Vulkan etc.

This is actually an advantage of SYCL. OpenCL is only portable if you stick to roughly ancient OpenCL 1.2 features. Much of the newer stuff is not universally supported.

The fact that OpenCL is dependant on hardware vendors to implement it means that it is extremely sensitive to vendor politics and adoption friction. We have seen this with OpenCL.

You don't need hardware vendors to explicitly support SYCL. You only need hardware vendors to support \*some\* intermediate representation and runtime API that SYCL compilers can target.

Both major SYCL compilers AdaptiveCpp and DPC++ can target SPIR-V devices and OpenCL. So if your hardware vendor provides an OpenCL implementation that supports SPIR-V ingestion, SYCL will ""just work"".

Additionally, SYCL compilers can also target other formats and runtimes if hardware vendors are reluctant to support OpenCL, such as CUDA runtime with PTX code, or HIP with amdgcn code.

> Unlike templates the code is runtime generated and does not come with huge bloat.

If you have a SYCL compiler that has a unified JIT compiler like AdaptiveCpp, you can also do similar things in SYCL by relying on IR transformations at runtime, with the added benefit of C++ type safety. No need to instantiate tons of templates.  


>Nobody catched SyCL apart of Intel. You need not only AMD but nVidia and other smaller vendors. And each of them doing its own s..t

As I said it's not really necessary for hardware vendors to explicitly support SYCL. They just need to support some intermediate representation and runtime API for compute applications.

Also, for most hardware there are high quality compiler backends publicly available, e.g. in LLVM. Anybody can use those, so it does not require hardware vendor expertise anymore to wire up a high performance compiler. So it really matters only little whether hardware vendors explicitly support SYCL.

In fact, my experience and personal opinion working in this space is that hardware vendors should take their hands off of our programming models. Leaving programming models in the hands of hardware vendors (like with OpenCL) only creates political issues and adoption friction. We as user community - be it scientists, ML people, etc - should build compilers for the programming models we want to use ourselves in order to not depend on hardware vendors for our code investments. Thanks to publicly compiler backends, this is now possible and we see this with high-performance community projects like AdaptiveCpp.",9/7/2024 18:38,llzrtex,1fa8vq5,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

Delicious-View-8688,"Hmm... what was the role? Junior or a bit more experienced? How much time were you given? Who was the intended audience for the report? These may help answer your question. Perhaps they simply didn't have the time to provide feedback because of the number of submissions.

I'll be honest, 1. I skipped the writing part after the executive summary, and 2. I didn't read past the first block of code either. Mostly because it didn't come off as worth reading further. If there were dozens of submissions, I don't think I would have given it much more thought.

The text part needs improvement. I couldn't get what or who the report was for. The structure conveys that the report is for a technical audience, and most of the language reflects that. Yet, the executive summary uses very colourful language and extremely confident conclusions and self congratulations, and the rest of the notebook does not back that up (didn't need to read it to come to that conclusion). My guess is that they were expecting the report be targeted to a business audience. Concise and clear language would have been better.

The code part was a little like reading from text written by a non-native python/pandas/keras speaker. For example, handling of string columns chose the most indirect and slow method possible. I would have preferred a more ""native"" and efficience code. Don't get me wrong, it is not the most terrible code I have seen, but it would depend on what other candidates may have written. If it wasn't for an entry-level position, I would not consider it any further. Even if it was for an entry-level, I probably would not put it at the top of the pile.

So, the writing and coding styles aside, my main question is: Why wasn't there an EDA? I did not need to read the modelling part (which is what they asked for), because none of it would have been justified. Heck, I don't even know what the distribution of the stars look like, why would I believe that the ~ 1 star error is small? What would be an alternative simple model to compare it against? Why NN? Why isn't the train-test split based on year? Why is the transformation being applied before the train-test split? Why is removing ""outliers"" justified, what fraction of the data did this represent? A lot of this may have been addressed in an EDA.

Anyway, these are my first impressions from a very cursory look. Don't take it to heart. I am intentionally being picky in hopes to explain why they may have rejected it without feedback.

Instead, for each matrix row, you may be able to spend just a few ints (depending on how wide the matrix is), using the ints’ bits to indicate which matrix positions are nonzero. This would likely work best if you could \*force\* 50% sparsity per row- then you could have a “dense storage” part that would have all the nonzeroes packed in (half the width of the original matrix), and you’d pay a little per-row overhead to store those ints used as bitmasks.

Mafixo,"A great math or stats question for entry-level candidates is one that tests their fundamental understanding, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. One question I like to ask is:

**""Explain the difference between correlation and causation. Can you give an example where two variables are highly correlated, but there’s no causal relationship between them?""**

This question often trips candidates up because while most understand the concept of correlation vs. causation, they struggle to articulate it clearly or provide a good example. It also reveals their depth of understanding in statistical reasoning and whether they have an intuitive grasp of real-world scenarios where this distinction matters.

Another question that can set candidates apart is:

**""How would you explain p-value to someone without a statistics background?""**

This is deceptively simple but requires a solid understanding of statistical significance and the ability to communicate it clearly to non-experts. Many candidates can define a p-value, but the ones who stand out are those who can break it down in simple, intuitive terms.

For probability, I like to ask:

**""If you flip two coins, what is the probability that at least one of them will be heads?""**

This one sounds straightforward, but I’ve seen candidates get tangled up in the logic. Those who can quickly break it down into complementary probabilities (i.e., 1 - P(both tails)) demonstrate their problem-solving approach effectively.

These types of questions are great for setting candidates apart because they require both technical knowledge and the ability to think critically and explain complex concepts.",9/8/2024 23:11,lm710f1,1f9yxqa,datascience,t5_2sptq,POSITIVE

lakeland_nz,"A friend of mine runs one I like. Obviously I'm biased, but I'll focus on what's different so you can see where they normally fall down.

The main problem isn't the agency, it's what companies choose to engage an agency rather than build their own team.  Companies have to pay a premium to use the service, and often it's because the company can't hire good staff. For example their culture might be broken so even if they get lucky and hire someone competent, that person will soon leave.   

That's probably the ideal situation.   The staffing agency is acting as a cultural bubble to protect you from the environment at the client.  It's a similar reason to why marketing agencies are usually better than hiring your own team.

Staff members can relax on a Friday afternoon back at the agency.  They can relax with other competent people, including discussing how to solve their current problems.  They can even swap clients if one gets too annoying.

Often the client only hires a single DS.  Had they hired directly, that person would be stuck doing everything with parents skills they have and no peers.  Hiring a FTE from an agency means the DS can swap out with a DE for some heavy engineering.  

I've deliberately written this as positive experiences so you can read between the lines on how things can go wrong.  If you're looking for a different word to Google, try body shopping.",8/28/2024 19:40,lke5220,1f3dlkt,datascience,t5_2sptq,NEUTRAL

GryffinLoL,"I just typed up about a full page response to this, and then my computer crashed on me. I'm going to try to summarize. 

  
1.) Every data scientist should have imposter syndrome. I might be biased because I work as a data scientist in cybersecurity, and both of those are fast-moving fields. But the truth of it is, there are constantly new discoveries, new algorithms, new libraries, new programming languages, and updates to all of these things being made constantly. You cannot, and will not, ever be an expert at everything, and the faster you accept that, the better off you are going to be. 

  
2.) You do not have to be the PhD data scientist superstar who has won 87 hackathons, has 26 patents, solved every leetcode problem, invented XGBoost, and co-wrote Rust in order to bring value to your team. The simple truth of things is that more often than not, a business gets more value out of someone who writes clean code, builds consistent documentation for processes, and can build simple dashboards/visualizations that efficiently communicate insights to the business. It's important to be able to separate two things - expertise of the data analytics field, versus bringing value to the business. 

  
3.) The most concerning thing to me in your write-up is that you mention that you cry every day. More than anything else, I would encourage you to try to identify why you're crying. Are your teammates creating a toxic work environment? Is your boss threatening to fire you? You might be inflicting some of this on yourself by over-worrying. In my first job on a team that was built around Python, I didn't fully know Python. I found myself having to Google/Stack Overflow every single thing. And I was terrified that one day, someone would see my code and realize that I was a complete idiot, and fire me on the spot. But that never happened, and now I build the SOLID/OOP standards for my team, and own an open source repo with over 25k lines of code (the line count isn't important, but it would have blown me away back when I started). The simple truth is that you need to just keep putting in the work. 

  
4.) Try to start by finding positives in yourself. You would not have been hired for the job if you weren't able to convince a number of people that you deserved it. You said yourself that you are hard working. You should NOT be afraid to have a 1:1 with your boss - but it's also critically important that you don't just tell your boss that you think you suck at everything ever, either. I think you should try to meet with your boss, but before you do - take an actual, honest inventory of what you think your skill set is, what your positives are, and what your accomplishments so far have been. Then, try to identify what you think your gaps are, or the areas where you think you'd benefit from additional knowledge. You will be substantially better off by trying to address individual gaps in your skill set, instead of coming in overwhelmed and trash talking yourself. Put yourself in your manager's shoes - if someone came in and said: ""Hey, I'd like some advice on how I can better learn visualizations in Python."" - that's something that either your manager or your teammates should be able to help. People can recommend resources/guides to you, or give advice on what they struggled with. Try to set yourself up for success - but most importantly, it is OKAY to embrace a student's mindset, identify gaps in your knowledge, and try to address them.

  
Data science, to me, has been trying to drink from a firehose every day. I have been in the field for 12 years now. There is always more to learn. Learning to enjoy that, instead of fear it, is important. But critically, you need to take care of yourself too. You need to protect your mental health. I think it's important that you identify why you're so afraid/upset, and address that. Imposter syndrome is likely always going to be there in some form - but that doesn't mean constant anxiety and tears.",9/2/2024 11:58,ll4t7oc,1f73w6p,datascience,t5_2sptq,POSITIVE

klmsa,"Something else to consider is that most managers have this poor experience when they're new to the role. It is a different set of skills to develop, and no one is good at it right away. It took several years to stop feeling stressed out, and it was mostly because I was learning via firehose method. I went back to IC in another company (for a slight raise), and now I'm back in management in that business (for an even larger raise), absolutely loving my team and understanding how to better balance my life with new skills. I loved my work as an IC, and I could still go back and do it well, but there's something very satisfying about helping others to succeed (and being rewarded for doing so).

Consider that most new managers get a good reputation with their teams (and their leaders, although at a lesser rate). That's because they're giving too much of themselves to that team effort, and usually not expecting enough from the rest of the team. The hard part about management for good people is not doing that. Saying no and disappointing people sometimes, and learning to challenge the right people at the right level. This is especially hard when we're young. We care a little (hopefully just a little) less as we age.

If it's just money, though, management isn't the path unless you're really shooting for an executive job. I have several people that report to me that make more money than I do.

MrMonday11235,"> How is defamation law likely to form the basis of any cause of action? 

OK, let's say someone makes AI-generated content of you saying something you didn't say. 

In the USA (which is where both Swift and Trump reside at time of writing, and so is the only jurisdiction worth considering), we have the First Amendment, which limits the ability of the government to police speech. First Amendment protections are interpreted so broadly that [even laws criminalising the commercial production, sale, and possession of animal cruelty video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Stevens) does not pass muster. Heck, I'm no legal expert, but it looks like [even laws against revenge porn](https://www.dhillonlaw.com/revenge-porn-and-the-first-amendment/) aren't exactly safe from First Amendment scrutiny.

So, criminal laws against AI-generated fakes are likely to fall at the First (haha) hurdle. That leaves you with civil suits. What argument would you be making in civil court to try to punish the person making that content? You can't sue people simply for saying mean things about you (at least, not with the expectation of success at trial), and you can't sue people for simple hyperbole either (e.g. satirical comics and the like which exaggerate your position to ridiculousness). Your argument would likely have to be that 

1. The AI-generated content was made to appear as though you said or did something;
2. You did not actually do or say anything substantively similar to what said content makes it look like you said/did; and
3. The content's suggestion that you said/did those things causes/caused harm to your reputation; and
4. This was either the deliberate intent or the easily foreseeable consequence of using AI to generate that particular content

Congratulations, you're making a defamation argument!

For a practical example, let's take the relevant example from the article -- Trump (or Trump supporters) using AI generated fakes of Swift to try to bring Swifties into the MAGA fold. If she wanted, Swift could likely already bring a claim against whomever started this whole thing under defamation law. It wouldn't necessarily be an easy case, granted, since she's a public figure, but there are clear arguments she can make with regard to damage to her personal brand by associating her (someone with, as far as I can tell, a mostly milquetoast progressive message to her work) with a candidate known for virulent racism and xenophobia, and who is the candidate for a political party known for misogyny and homophobia/transphobia as well.

Any law against AI impersonation that gave rise to a civil cause of action would likely be built the same way; after all, that's generally how the law works, with later pieces re-using and building on frameworks previously put together. Perhaps this new cause of action would remove the burden of needing to prove damage to your reputation when AI was used to impersonate you, thereby lowering the bar to just showing the falsity of the impersonated content, the fact that it was created using AI, and that the person making the content knew (or should've known with the most basic research) that the content they were creating was substantially false. Anything more than that would likely face substantial First Amendment challenges.

> When it comes to moronic computers? You don't think a computer could ever comprehend reality?

As someone who actively works on and with cutting edge machine learning, I think we're much further away from computers having sufficiently robust understandings of reality to outperform educated humans on judging matters like ""what qualifies as a 'real person' for the purposes of a law regarding AI generated impersonation"" than most VC techbros think we are... which is the relevant standard for the point I was making, i.e. ""we don't need to be able to rigorously define 'real person' in order to start making laws about AI impersonation"".

> Who knows it when they see what?

I see you didn't even bother to do a cursory Google search of what I referenced. [Here's a link to Wikipedia for you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it).

In case your confusion is just about what the relevant antecedent to ""it"" would be in this case for ""I know it when I see it"", that would be ""real person"". That is to say, the judge's answer to your question that I quoted in my comment, ""what are real people?"" would be ""I know a real person when I see one"" even if ""real person"" isn't explicitly defined for an anti-AI impersonation law.

> I thought we knew what a fake picture was?

What are you on about now, and what relevance does it have to the point I was making?

> I think you're trying to explain yourself before you finish speaking and it makes you look sloppy.

I think *you're* trying to inject artificial, sovereign-citizen-esque nitpicking into an issue for the sake of arguing.

If you impersonate Taylor Swift using AI to make it seem like she, I don't know, eats babies or something, and she takes you to court over it, and your primary defense is ""the law against AI impersonation is unconstitutionally vague because it doesn't define 'what is a real person'"", you're going to be laughed out of the courtroom at best and hauled into jail for contempt of court at worst. It isn't a real problem, and the fact that you think it would be makes you look like a fool to anyone with even the most basic knowledge of how the judicial system works.

""The law"" isn't magical words you can speak in order to get whatever result you want; it's (supposed to be) a sensible set of rules and frameworks for the purpose of creating and maintaining an orderly society. How well it does that is a matter of great debate, of course, but stuff like ""we don't know what constitutes a real person"" isn't going to be an actual legal concern until we reach actual general intelligence, which we're not anywhere near at present.",9/11/2024 10:55,lml31xa,1fe17l9,technology,t5_2qh16,NEUTRAL

With neural nets one of the only differences in training NNs is that you use minmaxscaler(), that is to say data is scaled from 0-1. Each ML algorithm will have these little nuances you’ll only learn through reading docs, but they are all so similar in how you preprocess the data. So with logistic regression, you need a constant column, a detail you’d need to see in an example found in the documentation.

BurgisMcGee,"I would like some candid advice on whether this field is a good fit for me.

I am a 33 y/o with a PhD in political science. My academic background is mainly in political philosophy, but I took the basic quantitative methods and research methods courses for the master's degree. I'm currently transitioning careers and working part-time as a private tutor since the academic job market in my field is a complete dumpster fire. I got the idea a year ago to try to pivot into data analytics roles. In the last year I've completed the Hopkins coursera calculus sequence through Johns Hopkins, the math for machine learning specialization through [DeepLearning.Ai](http://deeplearning.ai/), and a few online certificates through Datacamp (Associate Data Scientist with R, SQL associate). I've also tried to bone up on my stats knowledge reading David Freedman's *Statistical Models* and Fox's applied regression analysis textbook. 

I've realized that I really enjoy programming and working with data, and I wake up most mornings regretting that I didn't take more math and statistics classes in college. Realistically, however, I need to start actually earning money and I know that I'm not where I need to be with this job market. This makes it hard to do the problem sets and stay focused. Given my age and personal situation it would also be hard to me to go back to school for another master's degree.

Checking all the boxes on the job requirements is a distant second to finding someone who has those qualities because a smart, motivated and productive person will figure out what they need to figure out.

I'm a 24 year old student from Belgium, currently studying computational statistics. I will graduate next year and I want to start my career as a data scientist.

Therefore, I have a few questions and I would greatly appreciate any advice or experiences you could share:

- For those of you who have moved abroad to work as data scientists, where did you go and what has your experience been like? What were some of the challenges and rewards? 

- I'm aware that the cost of living might be higher in some countries, but is it still worth it in terms of career growth and salary?

- How difficult is it to apply for a workers visa in the US or other countries? How will I have the best chances?

- Any other tips or advice for someone who wants to make this move?

Pretty much anything where your dependent variable underlyingly is a behavioural/psychological variable (i.e. seconds spent on a site to indicate the user likes the site more etc.) is already on average harder to replicate because we're dealing with human psychology which is rather unlikely to follow as strict laws of nature as for instance a plane being able to fly. 

Then there's the additional can of worms whether your stats take into account that there's inherent unknowns/  randomness in some of your independent variables. So for an a/b test you might be better off running a mixed model with random slopes and intercepts so your analysis is more trustworthy than an ANOVA.

mvw2,"As just a lowly engineer of the above water variety, this reads as complete bunk.  Cool, you can vaporize water with lasers.  There's a design problem with that too, but I'll ignore it.  None of this solves the very big issue.  You still HAVE TO mechanically displace water through work.  There is a big chunk of mechanical work you're doing, and ""bubbles around the hull"" doesn't fix this problem.  Surface friction isn't a dominant problem.  The big picture is this doesn't fix efficiency of motion of plunging an object through an incompressible liquid.

I guess I should talk about the laser thing I skipped.

Want to know how much a 2 mega watt laser, if 100% efficient can vaporize per second to shove and make this giant ass boat fly through water at amazing speeds?  One quart of water per second.  One tiny, miniscule quart of water.  This tiny quart of vaporized water is expected to shove this big ass boat through water at amazing speeds.  Ever fart in a pool?  Did that propel you across the pool at amazing speeds?  This is different you say.  This is vaporization, an explosion of volume!  Surely that's a lot, right?  Well...no.  You're effectively turning 1 quart of water to 1.4 quarts of water at that depth.  Your asking 0.4 quarts, basically a pint of displacement per second to MOVE an entire sub.  But this is also an inertia problem.  That little pint of air is also pushing in other directions, up, down, sideways, and rearward expanding into the rest of the ocean.  The mechanical force that pint of air can shove upon a 30 million lbs vessel is basically imperceptible.

The REAL problem is the energy.  When taking about vaporizing water, you're taking about a LOT of energy.  Even 2 megawatts doesn't go far.  You're sneezing in a tornado.  It's a scale problem due to the immense phase change requirements.

In fact, this actually makes the article a literal joke, as in the intent itself of the article is a sham, one that banks on ignorance.",9/7/2024 16:58,llz9w8h,1fbamzm,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

Mr_ToDo,"I haven't seen a UBI plan yet that was higher than the existing poverty level and generally the minimum wage. 

From what I see it's not intended to be a sit back and do nothing payment but a universal safety net. Or, well, a univeral basic income. Then as you earn more you get less of the UBI, not dollar for dollar or there's be less intensive to earn more since you'd have to earn more than UBI before you see even one buck more.

It's not a bad plan. It gives people breathing room for the unexpected or simply to do things they otherwise wouldn't. Want to quit your job because your boss sucks but don't know when you'll find a new one, UBI, want to start that small business but are afraid because don't know when it'll show any real profit, UBI. 

It'd be a lovely idea to try for a while, but we keep pulling the rug out on the trial programs before we get any meaningful data(generally because it was a competing political parties idea and we know we can't have that).

Despite them filling different needs I tend to compare UBI to minimum wage. Yes prices will go up, but to say that they'll rise 1:1 is kind of silly. And yes there are places where housing shortages have caused rent to skyrocket but try not to fall into the trap of assuming that what you see on reddit and the news is the how the entire country/world lives(and hey if people did actually want to live off of UBI it would open up an entirely new housing market in the middle of low cost but fuck nowhere since you don't need the normal job markets.

LindenTom250,"International law holds that states cannot arbitrarily deny nationality, especially in ways that violate human rights or create statelessness. Palestinians in the occupied territories are entitled to the title, rights, and protections of citizenship under international law, regardless of Israel's refusal to recognize them as such. Given that Israel has exercised de facto sovereignty over these areas for over 20 years, the reasonable period has been quiet exhausted where it isn't permanent but its a lot about political will. 

As a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Israel is obligated, under the dominant view in international law, to provide citizenship to those in annexed territories. Failure to do so likely constitutes a violation of its obligations under the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.

MonsieurVox,"I'm now a senior engineer and absolutely love my job, but it hasn't always been that way. It's impossible to give a blanket ""pros and cons"" list because there are so many different roles/niches within cybersecurity. For example, a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst is going to have a much different experience than a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) specialist.

I can give you my subjective take, but take it with a grain of salt because everyone's situation is unique.

Pros:

* Great earning potential
* Constantly learning new tech
* Laid-back work environment (much less restrictive than a lot of white collar careers)
* Opportunities to earn certifications and continuing education on the employer's dime

Cons:

* Periodic on-call rotations that can be disruptive to work/life balance
* The double-edged sword of learning new tech is that your skills can quickly become obsolete
* ""Imposter syndrome"" can be very strong for the first few years, and honestly never *fully* goes away
* Since security is a cost center, leaders in many companies are constantly trying to tighten the purse strings on security, resulting in the constant need to do more with less
* Sometimes security can be viewed as a blocker/hindrance to progress and will get resistance from external teams. That's not really the case at my company but it's a common complaint
* Huge bottleneck in the early career stage. That is to say, most companies want to hire someone who's already experienced than to train someone from the ground up.

Cutting all of those jobs was about keeping the profits from going down further but they'd have to go down a LOT more to not still be profit.  A publisher that isn't run by greed would be doing more to keep its devs and help make their lives better; the devs are the ones creating the products that drive that profit, after all.  It's possible for a company to be *gasp* NOT profitable for maybe a fiscal year and still do good for its employees.  But that's just not the driving factor of large, successful corporations in the modern age.  Greed wins over everything else.

grimwald,"Most ransomware groups just cast a wide net. I am sure some groups do intentionally target hospitals though - probably nation states.

There's been a few instances where Children's hospitals have fallen victim to ransomware and criminals have decrypted the data without payment. This is likely due to threat of doxxing from other criminal groups that consider it despicable behaviour, or because of their own moral compasses.

Regardless if they are government run, or privately run, hospitals are usually heavily regulated, meaning they often will pay for services of third party vendors, along with their own internal IT. I can speak from experience saying that it is more or less who can do the best mental/financial gymnastics to have the least amount of responsibility and coverage for the most amount of money negotiated in the contract. Subcontracting alone, opens up all kinds of headaches even outside of security.

Plentiful attack surfaces makes them an immediately appealing target. There are also loads of things that are just done to check a regulatory box, but not actually done in a way that makes infrastructure more secure. These organizations also have huge administrative bodies, with both digital and physical infrastructure that would make even seasoned IT or Security professionals head spin.

Healthcare makes me beyond nervous as someone who actually works in the field. Makes me grateful to mostly deal with private business.

wiqr,">It's almost impossible to fire employees in the EU, so it's difficult to build a good team

First - how is work stability a bad thing?

Second - Firing someone does take more substantial reasoning than ""I feel like it"", but is still possible. But for building a team, this isn't an issue. When you hire someone, you first hire them for 3-month probation period during which you can terminate without giving a reason, and after which you can just let the contract expire if that person proves not up to your standard. Then, depending on the country, you can keep them on limited time contracts for some time (in my case it's total of three years), so if you feel like this person isn't contributing enough, you just don't prolong their contract, and you don't have to justify it.

Afterwards, it's really an issue of finding a good reason, and good reason can be as simple as ""loss of personal trust to an employee"" - especially on executive or confidential level. Refusing to sign an NDA is almost guaranteed termination. Hell, I've seen people fired over getting a DUI or speeding related driver license suspension for ""loss of necessary qualifications"". I've seen someone fired for prolonged medical leave (""Prolonged absence distruptive to team's productivity and work schedule"") and developing diabetes (""Medically unfit for designated position"" - they were working night shifts, and often were alone in the room for hours).

Because I just feel that building, deploying and deploying ML models is hard and that it could be improved. I believe it’s hard because of complex data engineering (data is segregated from the ML lifecycle), non-reproducible workflows and finally because of segregated tooling and infrastructure.

MAGArRacist,"I took our workflow and proceduralized it with Python. At the end of the day, it's all just HTTP requests, specific endpoints, and structured data, right? 

For instance, we create a report using a signed PDF Test Plan / Test Plan created in PlexTrac. Why not have Python pull out the relevant details, locate the Client in PlexTrac, and create the initial report once a watching process notices that we got approval to test? I took little things like this and just kept building. 

I'm hoping to get the time soon to create additional watchers that look for screenshots, and based on their naming scheme, add findings -and your screenshot- to the report. It would be really cool to figure out a way to add OCR so I could programmatically determine the effected asset, but I'm not sure how difficult that is on a technical level. I also wrote a bunch of parsers for reports from other tools so their findings can be added into 'Best Practice' sections or wherever else we see fit without having to add their findings in piecemeal. 

I don't know if you have ever made use of Python's difflib, but it's 🔥🔥🔥 when it comes to potential small showstoppers like minor differences in Clients' names in PlexTrac and your documentation. Typo? No problem. Bad typo? Here's a tab-completing readline prompt and your options.

A lot of what we see today is a product of allowing corporations to become too big. Here’s what happens:

A small business owner makes a new product and sells it on Amazon, it’s naturally a bit pricey because the small business doesn’t have the sourcing size or power to receive large discounts.

Amazon sees how well this product is doing and says “Wow! We can make this product for much cheaper, promote it on our site AND we can destroy this small business!”

So now, the small business is up against a trillion dollar company and it’s back to the mines for them.

dimy93,"I think, while the person is a first-time reviewer, his arguments were extremely good as to why he accepted or rejected the papers, and he seems to have spent proper time reviewing his submissions. While I do not have the papers and his reviews in front of me, he seems to have put in the time and effort. Also, if anything, I feel that first-time reviewers these days give better reviews as they still care while senior people give reviews while scrolling the internet on their toilet bowls. 1/6 is absolutely normal, especially in a saturated field like his. That said I sympathize with your frustration on general reviewer quality. It has been very poor lately. So maybe, can we appreciate the person that really tried doing his best work so that we have more good reviewers on conferences?

Also note that the job of a good reviewer is not only to accept the good papers but make sure the bad ones be rejected. It is equally frustrating to not have your good paper accepted and if you have a good poster at Neurips 2022 but nothing spectacular and then someone copies your idea without citing you and gets best paper award at Neurips 2023 and that has happened. Good reviewer should prevent that and there is more papers like this than you might realize without actually having reviewed. The worst kind of reviewers are those that always give 4/5 to all of their papers, copy the abstract and give one random argument out of their rear parts why not higher. Actually having bunch of 2s and 3s and one 8 sounds just statistically a hallmark of a good reviewer. Of course, that doesn't mean you should aim as a reviewer to always give something like this but if you land at it as reviewing you know that probably you did a good job.",7/30/2024 7:09,lfm4w0b,1ef1var,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,POSITIVE

LITTLE-GUNTER,"that idiot is just mad because he wants to run stupid rich smoky tunes without his ECU getting upset at him for it. defeat devices only “turn off check engine lights” in the same way that cutting wires from the instrument panel to the engine bay would.

they’re stupid, stupid, *stupid* hardware. yes, i’m aware DPFs and diesel exhaust fluid are nasty and annoying stopgap solutions for emissions; yes, i’m aware it’s a steeper hill to climb to make diesels run cleanly; ***no,*** a defeat device will not make either of these things easier. in fact, it will almost certainly make your vehicle WORSE.

nobody who runs these parts knows how engines even work. if there’s black smoke leaving your exhaust, it’s not just that your engine is having terrible emissions, it’s ALSO throwing between a quarter and a third of its potential horsepower and torque into your exhaust instead of your driveshaft! combustion engines make their rotational energy through COMBUSTION (shocker!!) and when uncombusted fuel leaves the exhaust, that means you are either swamping your cylinders with too much fuel or your air intake is so choked that only mucinex and a rhinoplasty would help it breathe.",9/18/2024 15:27,lnqwbim,1fjqqoi,technology,t5_2qh16,NEGATIVE

baltinerdist,"One of the most obnoxious men I’ve ever met in my life absolutely loved to start sentence after sentence with “As a feminist…” Anytime any subject that even remotely had to do with women came up, I knew it was seconds until we heard, “Well as a feminist,” and then whatever trite bullshit he was going to say. In reality, he wasn’t any better or worse on women’s issues that anyone else, he just reeeeally wanted everyone around him to know he was so, so a feminist.

I get such a sense of deja vu from you. I took a quick scroll through your Reddit profile and your Twitter and it was just “as a Hollywood filmmaker” over and over and over again. You’ve got what, nine credits on IMDB, none of which are for any work I’ve ever heard of. They’re all shorts that don’t even have ratings on IMDB where you write and directed and EP’d them all. 

I feel like you’re a “Hollywood filmmaker” in the same way I’m an “acclaimed Southern food chef” because I’ve cooked southern food before and people liked it. You might be in Hollywood (though three years ago you were in Tampa) and you might make filmed content, but buying a RED after film school does not a Spielberg make.

Further, you… didn’t actually make anything here, either. You let AI do the writing for you (which, while it is allowed by the WGA, is strongly discouraged) and you let AI “shoot your film.” You didn’t even write the Midjourney prompts, you let the AI do that, too. So not only did you yourself do almost nothing here, your creative output is the result of the scalping of terabytes of legitimate artists’ work to train these models.

You took a frozen lasagna, had someone else cook it, and your contribution was cutting the slice and putting it on a plate and now you’re expecting people to celebrate you for your homemade recipe.

Feeling-Carry6446,"I'm thinking of transitioning out of data science, at least from the private sector. I expect to be on the job market soon due to downsizing. I have 15 years in analytics, the last 5 as a data analyst with a data scientist title, writing queries and building BI dashboards. I have not put a model into production in 2 years because it has not been asked of our team, but I have helped three consulting firms understand our data so they can build models for us. 

I think I haven't worked at a company that understands how to use models to generate value. My most common request is to deliver a spreadsheet so a product owner can look at it and find insights. It pays well but I don't expect to find another job like this because I don't have experience that matches my title. 

Is it worth it to train up in Gen AI and try to find another private sector data science job? Should I be looking in the public sector, where the work might be less political and more about problem-solving than justifying some project's continued existence?

> This blog post is being reported as evidence that Microsoft is moving security vendors ""out of the kernel,"" but that seems to me a gross misinterpretation. The only mention here is to improve security features outside the kernel. That's hardly an eviction notice. 

> To wit:

>>   Both our customers and ecosystem partners have called on Microsoft to provide additional security capabilities outside of kernel mode which, along with SDP, can be used to create highly available security solutions. At the summit, Microsoft and partners discussed the requirements and key challenges in creating a new platform which can meet the needs of security vendors.

> This is not an announcement that kernel drivers are dying—not even ELAM! And of course, why would they do that, when backwards compatibility is a religion at Microsoft?

> I wholly expect some user mode APIs to be either documented or created, but calling this the ""end of anti-cheat"" or whatever is a little silly, imo.

Did nobody in the factory question why they were building explosive pagers? or was it a disguised component that only a few people knew about?  Maybe everybody at the factory was in on the plan? Maybe it was just one guy, installing them in all 5,000 pagers?

Imagine the risks this operation took. All the things that could have gone wrong. 

-  industrial accident: explosive set off in the factory, because they are being handled like consumer electronics rather than explosive devices

-  someone with a rigged pager tries to travel, airport security or bomb-sniffing dog detects the pager

-  and if they were undetectable, now Hezbollah and friends know of of an explosive device that can make it past security

-  they weren't accidentally set off early during transport and delivery. (Probably goes to show how expert the designers were)

-  near-simultaneous activation, presumably using Lebanon's own cell network.  What if someone had noticed the unusual signal being sent out rapid-fire, and pulled the plug?

-  not one of them stopped working and was taken apart by some tinkerer to try to fix it. This is impressive: even Apple can't deliver 5,000 devices without a few duds.

-  no diversion of some of the product. If these were produced at a typical factory we might expect a few to end up sold off-books, severely discounted.

Deatlev,"On another note (having a monology here) this is why it's important to understand how we work in our brains to also be able to function normally given that there are a lot of things happening around us.

E.g. knowing how anticipation for something works, can help us creating anticipation for something that is productive to us.  It can also help us understand the implications of doing shit that hooks up to our reward system.

I know for a fact that a lot of game developers hire cognitive behavioural scientists, just to hook people up on a game. 

And the sad thing is, when something is giving you a reward more than your ordinary life, you'll start to like that more, sometimes more than living life and working. 

It's like a metronome, and games, short videos (looking at you TikTok!) tick immensely faster than for instance reading a book, so it's waaaay easier to do that shit than to do ""real"" stuff like not wasting your life.

So with that in mind, balancing these short term reward brain-fuckups in our technological world is vastly important, if you want to feel fulfilled at the end of the day, week, month, year and your life. Because something within us just knows that doom scrolling and what not is not fulfilling. It fucks you up, draws you into a depression, a dark void of nothingness than the feeling of being controlled by something else than your mind, which is true, it's your subconscious mind.",9/19/2024 6:59,lnv10ng,1fkduu7,ChatGPT,t5_7hqomg,NEGATIVE

As I was saying, they do not mean that a transformer model expresses a function whose outputs rotate as the inputs for every input and rotation you might choose.
They mean that a transformer model is initialized with random weights sampled from identical independent distributions for all axes, hence they start with no preferential directions whatsoever, and all training runs are statistically equivalent and would be so for every rotation of either the weights or the inputs, *at initialization*. They indeed note and confirm that the training itself is not rotationally equivariant by either the formal or ""intuitive"" definition, which causes the end models (that are always rotationally *variant*, express rotationally variant functions) to have not-identically distributed activations, with axes of a different scale wrt others.


They do not even formally prove that it is the optimizer, or formally show how it does it, they just mention it and it seems reasonable but not proven, anyway it's the only thing they change in the experiment.

gwern,"What I was thinking reading this was that MCMC is a completely wrong approach. Cats/dogs respond to the intonation/rhythm of their name when called in the usual babytalk fashion (I used to amuse myself by calling my dog by entirely different names with the same rhythm); so you're doing search over patterns of stressed syllables, not actual name phonetics. So it's a much smaller search space, and you also don't need to call each pattern one by one, you can overlap each one and wait for a reaction. All the stuff about likelihood and proposals you need to shoehorn it into MCMC is just a distraction from formulating this as a sequence search, which is a (mostly) algorithmic problem.

A better approach would be to do something like take a dog registry and convert to stress patterns, sort by popularity, and then try to convert it into something like a [de Bruijn sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence) to get through as many weighted stress-patterns as possible quickly. So you'd get something like a long string of singsong gibberish with overlapping stress-patterns which you'd recite until you notice the dog suddenly reacting, at which point you back up a few seconds and figure out which stress-pattern exactly in the sliding window of 1–4 stresses. Then you can look up the stress-pattern's matching names, and the dog's real name is somewhere in there. (You probably can't get the *real* real name, since the dog doesn't actually know it, but you can at least reduce it to a small set sorted by frequency.)",9/11/2024 13:53,lmlrotd,1fdzemt,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,NEUTRAL

> China-backed spies are said to have tore down their own 260,000-device botnet after the FBI and its international pals went after them.

> The botnet was controlled by the somewhat misnamed Integrity Technology Group, a Chinese business whose chairman has admitted that for years his company has “collected intelligence and performed reconnaissance for Chinese government security agencies,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said at the Aspen Digital computer security conference on Wednesday. The internet-connected bots consisted of PCs, servers, and Internet-of-Things gadgets infected with remote-control malware, and more than half of which were in the US.

> It was “all hands on deck,” Wray recounted, and his agents took control over the botnet’s command and control servers - after getting court authorization to do so. The Chinese team launched a DDoS strike against the Americans to disrupt them, and then tried to switch to backup control systems for the botnet, but were thwarted again. Then China gave up.

ejpusa,"Why are you not launching a new AI company a week? What's stopping you? Once you can get APIs to work for you, you can build anything. Healthcare is a $4.5 trillion $ ""business"" in the USA, and we're crashing. Maybe you can help fix it.

By 2030, AI will have profoundly transformed healthcare, streamlining every step of the patient journey and medical workflows.

### Patient Visit (Diagnosis to Follow-Up)
Imagine walking into a futuristic medical center. Upon arrival, a sensor detects your presence, linking you to your medical history. AI-powered systems check your vitals in real-time through non-invasive sensors. As you sit in the waiting room, AI analyzes your recent health data, cross-referencing it with millions of other cases to suggest probable conditions based on your symptoms and medical history.

When you meet the doctor, they receive AI-generated insights, including a list of possible diagnoses ranked by likelihood, potential treatments, and predicted outcomes based on your unique physiology. During diagnosis, AI tools assist with analyzing scans and labs, identifying patterns that might elude human eyes.

After treatment, AI continues to track your recovery remotely, alerting the healthcare team if your vitals deviate from the expected recovery path. Follow-ups happen virtually through wearable technology, feeding data to your physician without requiring in-person visits.

### Cardiology Department in 2030: Day of the Head of Cardiology
For a head of cardiology, AI enables an entirely new level of efficiency and insight. Here’s how their day might look:

- **Morning Briefing with AI Insights**: Before rounds, the department head reviews a dashboard summarizing patients’ overnight data—AI flags irregular heart patterns or potential post-surgery complications, prioritizing the most urgent cases. Using predictive modeling, the AI forecasts which patients might require closer monitoring or intervention, helping allocate resources efficiently.
  
- **Decision-Making**: The head consults an AI system to assist with tricky decisions, such as whether a patient with complex symptoms should undergo surgery. The AI draws from similar cases, pulling insights from both medical literature and real-time patient data to suggest tailored treatment options.

- **Research**: During research meetings, AI suggests new drug trial directions by predicting which molecular compounds might have the best chance of improving outcomes in heart disease. It can simulate results before costly trials, dramatically speeding up innovation.

- **Administrative Tasks**: AI tools automate much of the administrative burden, such as scheduling, tracking compliance with hospital protocols, and analyzing operational efficiency. AI systems detect patterns in staff workloads, patient outcomes, and supply management to optimize workflow and budget.

Yet, despite all these advancements, there are **underutilized opportunities**:
1. **Personalized Preventive Programs**: While cardiology is focused on treatment, AI could create hyper-personalized prevention programs that predict when a patient might develop a heart condition and suggest lifestyle interventions far in advance.
  
2. **AI as a Teaching Tool**: Department heads could use AI-powered simulations for continuous learning, helping junior doctors practice complex surgeries or understand nuanced diagnoses through virtual patient interactions.
  
3. **Predictive Maintenance of Equipment**: AI could be used to predict when critical medical devices will fail, preventing downtime by scheduling timely maintenance.

### 12 New AI Ideas for Healthcare by 2030:
1. **Genetic Risk Predictions**: AI tools will predict an individual’s risk of developing certain conditions based on genetic markers, advising tailored lifestyle choices.
2. **Mental Health Diagnosis via Speech**: AI could analyze speech patterns during routine consultations to detect early signs of mental health issues, like depression or anxiety, without needing a mental health professional.
3. **Nanorobots Controlled by AI**: For delicate surgeries, AI-powered nanorobots could navigate through the body to perform ultra-precise repairs or deliver targeted drug therapies.
4. **Continuous Health Monitoring via Smart Fabric**: Clothes with embedded AI-driven sensors will provide constant monitoring of vital signs, offering early warnings for health issues.
5. **Remote Robotic Surgeries**: Surgeons using AI-driven robots to perform surgeries remotely, with AI guiding the precision of every movement.
6. **AI-Generated Medical Research Papers**: AI could autonomously analyze vast quantities of medical data and draft research papers on emerging trends in diseases or treatments.
7. **Real-Time Emotion Monitoring**: AI could analyze facial expressions, voice, and biometrics to understand patient discomfort or emotional distress, adjusting care in real-time.
8. **Behavioral AI Coaches**: Patients receive AI-driven coaching on fitness, diet, and mental wellness, dynamically adjusting recommendations as their health data changes.
9. **Personalized Pharmacy Robots**: AI-powered robots could compound custom drugs in pharmacies, mixing unique formulas for individual patients based on their specific needs.
10. **Medical Record Voice Assistants**: Doctors could use AI assistants that transcribe and summarize patient interactions in real-time, reducing time spent on medical records.
11. **AI-Assisted Organ Regeneration**: Leveraging AI for tissue engineering, creating personalized organs for transplants by predicting the best growth environment for human cells.
12. **AI-Driven VR Therapy**: Virtual reality treatments guided by AI could help in areas like physical rehabilitation, mental health therapy, or even pain management.

I don't think anyone would prosecute, but I think any prosector who wanted to find a crime could.  For example, the article says: ""It’s not every day that a security researcher acquires the ability to generate counterfeit HTTPS certificates, track email activity, and the position to execute code of his choice on thousands of servers—all in a single blow that cost only $20 and a few minutes to land.""

venidomicella,"During improv I had to force myself to say something relevant to the topic without thinking more than 2-3 seconds. Because if you are in the stage, you have to say something and staying silent in the stage is much worse than saying something stupid.  

One of the problems that I see in people with communication problems is that they overthink not only when they communicate but also in many other parts of their lives.  

Forcing my brain to stop overthinking and saying something within 2-3 seconds even if whatever I’ll say won’t be perfect and doing this for a long time was the key.  That was helpful for both public and daily life communication.

That’s why I always think improv is the great way to reshape the brain to get used to take an action, and stop pursing the perfection. This brings better communication in my opinion. 

But you should do this for a long time and force yourself to be in the stage as much as you can because reshaping the brain takes time and requires pain as you become older. And the level of pain that you feel to convince yourself to go into the stage instaed of staying in the corner silently and watching others can give you idea about how shy you are, how far you should go to overcome this, and how difficult this process will be for you. ",7/28/2024 1:08,lf9sja4,1edp4xf,datascience,t5_2sptq,POSITIVE

Betee_Research,"Yes, that's correct. ""Data"" is technically a plural noun, with the singular form being ""datum."" However, in common usage, ""data"" is often treated as a singular noun, especially in informal contexts. Good to be aware of this distinction, especially in academic writing. Using ""data"" with a singular verb form like ""is"" or ""has"" is generally considered acceptable in modern usage, but purists may still prefer to treat it as plural and use verbs like ""are"" or ""have.""
