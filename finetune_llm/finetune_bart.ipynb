The templates will also give you only a snapshot-in-time service, while you will need to keep things chugging in the long-run to remain in good standing. Alternatively, you can ask your lawyer to review the templates, if that saves her/him time and costs you less, but using the templates instead of lawyers makes for a bad recipe. Incorporation templates feel like outsourcing your core engineering function - they might get you going now, but in the long-run you will struggle.
