Configuration Instructions
--------------------------

Before using the application, you need to configure it to ensure it can access the updated Reddit keyword files. Follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Hydra Configuration File**:
   - Find the Hydra configuration file, named `config.yaml` in the `conf` directory of the project.

2. **Update the Reddit Results File Path**:
   - Open the configuration file and locate the `reddit_results_file_for_ui` entry. This entry specifies the path where the application expects to find the updated Reddit keyword files.
   - Ensure that this path points to the correct location where you will place the updated files.

3. **Place the Updated Reddit Keyword Files**:
   - Download or prepare the updated Reddit keyword files that you want to use with the application.
   - Place these files in the directory specified by the `cfg.reddit_results_file_for_ui` path in the Hydra configuration file.

4. **Verify the Configuration**:
   - Double-check that the path is correct and that the files are accessible. You can do this by navigating to the specified directory in your terminal or file explorer.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

   reddit_results_file_for_ui: /Users/tayjohnny/Documents/My_MTECH/PLP/plp_practice_proj/reddit_keywords_results/reddit_keywords_hybrid.csv


Usage
-----

To launch the application, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    streamlit run src/streamlit_poc_with_gemma.py

Once the application is running, you will see the Streamlit UI in your web browser that looks like this:

- **Note**: If this is your first time using the application and the RAG vector database and the Gemma-2b model have not been downloaded locally, please be aware that it may take approximately 4 to 5 hours to prepare these data and model before the UI can be used. Subsequent usage will mot require this wait once the vector store has been built and Gemma-2B is downloaded locally.

**Note on Downloading the Gemma-2B Model**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you encounter a gated repository error while trying to access the Gemma-2B model on Hugging Face, follow these steps:

1. **Request Access**:
   - Go to the model's page on Hugging Face: `google/gemma-2b`.
   - Look for an option to request access. This may involve filling out a form or providing information about your intended use of the model.

2. **Wait for Approval**:
   - After submitting your request, wait for the Hugging Face team or the model's maintainers to approve your access. This can take some time.

3. **Authenticate**:
   - Once granted access, authenticate in your environment by running:

.. code-block:: bash
     
    huggingface-cli login

- Enter your Hugging Face token when prompted. You can find your token in your Hugging Face account settings.

4. **Download the Model**:
   - After authentication, you should be able to download and access the model without encountering the gated repo error.

5. **Check Your Code**:
   - Ensure that your code is correctly set up to load the model after you have access.
