"I am worried with how AI is improving propaganda - If you’ve been following the war in the Middle East on Twitter, you’ve probably noticed how difficult it’s been to distinguish what is real and what isn’t. Without getting into the gruesome details, a few days ago there was an image going around of a deceased child and there was heavy discussion into whether it was ai generated or real. There are some ai identifying tools but they appear to be very unreliable at the moment, so we don’t have a concrete way to make this distinction. I don’t know what the final findings were for that particular image, but either way it exemplifies how AI can be used to make dangerous propaganda. Apparently Google is developing a hidden digital watermark to identify the images generated by their AI’s.
